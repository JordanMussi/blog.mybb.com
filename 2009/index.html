<p>This release is to ensure that all users on 1.4.10 have the latest patches, to fix a small and rare bug that with malicious intent can be used to assist a Denial-of-Service attack, and to patch a low security issue that can allow a user to check for file existence outside of the web root.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-27.html" target="_blank">Tom Huls</a>, a true MyBB veteran, answers your interview questions.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>My name is Tom, as you might have guessed from the <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-27.html" target="_blank">cute avatar</a> I have been using for quite some time now. I'm 22 years old, from the Netherlands and a fifth year maths student. My MyBB experience started when I began using <a href="http://www.msgpluslive.net/">Messenger Plus!</a>, which I must have been sixteen or something back then. For some reason I felt the need to post on the <a href="http://www.msghelp.net/">forum</a> there, which was powered by a very early version of MyBB. After some time I made some comments about the bulletin board software and that's how I ended up here.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>This question gets asked regularly by other people and usually I reply by saying that I enjoy reading and walking. However, the number of unread books on my shelf keeps growing and I hardly get out. That's mostly because studying takes up quite a bit of my time, but I intend to shift the balance a bit in the next few months. In any case, solving maths riddles is not on the list ;-)</p>
<h4>Being one of the more reserved MyBB team members, what are some of your duties regarding MyBB?</h4>
<p>Basically, I am in charge of all that relates to internationalization and managing the translations. That includes uploading new translations when they're finished, assisting translators in their joband also keeping the Dutch translation up-to-date, which I'm the author of. Apart from that, I do some basic stuff as changing usernames and giving support, although unfortunately I often find myself short of time so I have not been as active as I would like to be. In addition, I've helped beta test quite a few releases.</p>
<h4>What are your three favourite MyBB features, and briefly, why?</h4>
<p>- The search functionality, because although I tend to know fairly well that something was posted I can almost never find it again by simply looking for the thread in a specific forum.<br />
- The edit button. It's surprising to see how often I find myself using it, even though I'm also a great fan of the Preview button.<br />
- Multiple PM recipients. Makes sending the same personal message to multiple staff members or translators just that tad bit easier.</p>
<h4>What does your average day look like?</h4>
<p>I always try to get up at 6 am. I wash up, quickly grab some bread and cycle to the nearest train station. The train leaves at 6.45 and after a quick transfer I arrive at university at 8.05. During the trip I often read some of the free newspapers distributed at train stations, listen to some music or podcast, skip through some math books or just enjoy the view. As there's always something to do I rarely ever find myself bored or annoyed by the time it takes me to get to university. The day then consists mainly of studying, either on my own or by attending lectures. A bit after 5 pm I return home, where I eat, quickly turn my laptop on and deal with new emails, forum posts and so on. Then I take a shower at about 9.30 and go to bed quickly after that to get my eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality, I hardly ever manage to get up at six in the morning, trains are delayed, at university I get distracted by other students so don't get much done and in the evening I go to bed way too late to get my eight hours of sleep :P</p>
<p>Many weekends are spent with my girlfriend, family visits or watching Formula 1 and snooker.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>I wish to become a mathematics teacher. Indeed, not very spectacular ;-)</p>
<h4>What is your favorite movie?</h4>
<p>I can't say I have a favorite movie. One of the more recent movies I saw was "La tourneuse de pages", which I found a very nice one. One that also stuck was Elephant; not so much a nice movie, but certainly moving.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-14621.html">Tom Moore</a> tells us everything we've wanted to know, and more!</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm Tom and I'm from Carlisle, Cumbria, in England. And yes, it rains almost every day(!). I'm a Marketing Designer and Systems Developer and I'm in the middle of moving to a nice new house just outside of the city. I'm starting my own business soon in Xekko, providing the usual plugins and software, but also providing hospitality for local events.</p>
<h4>How much time do you spend on the MyBB project weekly?</h4>
<p>It depends really - usually on how much Ryan pesters me into doing something(!). I spend most of my day at work working with MyBB and if there's a bug or two hanging around I'll normally have a go at fixing it. My lovely girlfriend would like to point out at this time that she thinks I spend too much on the project.</p>
<h4>Apart from MyBB, what do some of your hobbies include?</h4>
<p>I like spending time outside and visiting the lakes (what's the point in living in a <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Lake%20District">natural park</a> and spend all day inside?), but I like going to the cinema and enjoying the nightlife too. I'm an avid fan of Guitar Hero - I'm the drummer of our band - where having a deaf neighbor comes in handy.</p>
<h4>What is a feature that you would like to see in MyBB one day and why?</h4>
<p>I don't really have a particular feature I would like to see in MyBB, to be honest - it's already the best "forum" software you can get without all the unnecessary addons you don't really need to run a community. Well, except for what's planned for MyBB 2...</p>
<p>I work with MyBB in so many applications that I know you can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<h4>If you could do anything you wanted for one day, what would it be?</h4>
<p>Hmm, a day without coding would be good! There's too many things for one day though; I would probably have to live the life of a celebrity (famous one), and go out for a night out I think. Can't really complain at getting free drinks all night...</p>
<h4>What made you want to join the MyBB staff?</h4>
<p>I started using MyBB for an open-sourced alternative to Invision. I had enough free time to help out other people and I quickly grasped (almost) all aspects of MyBB. I guess I just wanted to help people out as much as I could, and then the opportunity came to join the team. Now as a developer, I really enjoy giving people headaches with the bugs I cause. <img title="Shy" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/shy.gif" alt="Shy" /></p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about your job</h4>
<p>I really love my job; for the past two years, I've been a Marketing Designer and Systems Developer for one of the UK's largest suppliers of civil engineering and drainage products (basically, they sell the sort of things to build roads and houses or public/industrial buildings, and drainage systems for things like football stadiums, car parks etc). I mainly do all of their advertising, literature and posters as my marketing part, but the other part of my job is to develop software systems to help the company. The part I hate the most is the printing out. I enjoy designing all of the leaflets and things, but really, really hate printing anywhere up to 5,000 of them - then putting them all into envelopes and stamping them. I also look after their website (which I hate, as I didn't make it!) and I've just finished making an e-shop for all the products we sell. Of course, it's powered by MyBB. <img title="Tongue" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" /></p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>In school, I did graphic design and always wanted to be a designer. So actually, I'm already in my dream career. A Ferrari or two wouldn't go a miss though...</p>
<h4>Your most memorable day was...</h4>
<p>I've had a few that come to mind, but I'll have to say my first day at work (where I work now). Before then, I was unemployed and getting into things I really shouldn't have done. It started a whole new chain of events which turned my life round for the better, and without that happening, I really don't know where I would be now. I met people that have truly changed my life, and I even met my girlfriend there too. So (so far), that's my memorable day.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>For those wanting to get into MyBB, don't underestimate it's ability to do whatever you want with it. It's structure and plugin system is the most powerful and easiest to learn out of all the free forum systems (and the paid ones too, come to mind). Take some time to learn it, and you'll find out just how much you can do with it.</p>
<p>Also, MyBB 2.0 will kick ass.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Sorry for the long delay, I've been busy with end of year school work. <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-13144.html">Doug</a> was eager to answer his questions, getting back to me less than a day after I sent his questions to him.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm Doug Sisk and I live in the barren lands of South Dakota in the US. I started working with MyBB back in 2007 when I started doing web design. MyBB is what inspired me to learn PHP &amp; MySQL, and by the end of 2008, I was on the MyBB Team. Besides MyBB, I'm the technical administrator for the Roller Coaster Simulator website <a href="http://rctlounge.com/">RCTLounge</a>, I own an Amusement Park Blog, <a href="http://parkthoughts.com/">Park Thoughts</a>, and I do some projects through my personal company, amply named <a href="http://www.dougsisk.com/">Doug Sisk Design</a>. I'm a Junior in High School, and I'm very active in band, participating in Marching, Concert, and Jazz band. I play synthesizer in Marching, piano in Jazz, and percussion in Concert. I also enjoy dreaming about Roller Coasters, watching TV, and hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>I was on the SQA team from November 2008-2009, and I am now a developer. I will be assisting in bug fixing the upcoming 1.6 series, and I will be also developing features for the future 2.0 series.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite gadget and why?</h4>
<p>I don't think I have a "favorite" gadget. I love my Computer, iPod Touch, and cell phone equally. The computer is where my work is, my iPod Touch has all the music and podcasts I enjoy, and my cell phone lets me keep in touch with friends. Between the iPod and cell phone though, I would choose the iPod as my favorite. It's great being able to keep up with the stuff I follow online right from it. I watch a ton of <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3</a> shows, mainly Diggnation, Tekzilla, and Film Riot. I occasionally watch Scam School from time to time.</p>
<h4>Describe to us what it means to you to be on the MyBB team.</h4>
<p>For me, being on the MyBB Team is a honor. This software is the best out there. There are very few free software programs out there that have the dedication and support like MyBB. It always amazes me how dedicated everyone is to the project for not being paid. For me, the payment is knowing that thousands of people have a way to communicate for free. It's still hard for me to believe that I'm part of such a huge project.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>I really don't know what my favorite feature in MyBB is. I'm sure I'll have one come 2.0 series!</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>When I was younger, my dream career was to go into the Amusement Park Industry. However, as I've grown older, I've realized that it isn't what I want to do everyday of my work life. I have done so well at web design and development, that it has already turned into a job rather than a hobby for me. I don't think there are many people that can say they make money from their hobby!</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Other than MyBB, I spend time checking up on the websites I work with, and the rest of the websites I follow. I mainly check out Facebook, Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/DougSD">DougSD</a>), and Digg. I also make my rounds looking at Web Design galleries and blogs to see what the trends are. When I'm not on computer, I'm usually listening to music (my favorite bands are Jack's Mannequin and Something Corporate), playing piano, drumming, drawing random sketches of websites and things, or watching TV (my favorite shows are Mythbusters, The Office, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon).</p>
<h4>Where do you see yourself in 10 years time?</h4>
<p>I have no clue where I'll be in 10 years. Hopefully, I'll be at a successful web design or marketing agency.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite programming language?</h4>
<p>PHP, as it's the only language I know fluently. I have a brief knowledge of jQuery and Javascript, but it's far from great. I've attempted to learn Ruby, but I gave up. Not my cup of tea.</p>
<h4>Who inspires you?</h4>
<p>The web design firm that has inspired me since I started in 2007 is <a href="http://electricpulp.com/">Electric Pulp</a>, South Dakota's best web design firm. They always have outstanding designs. I get all my inspiration from viewing galleries. My favorite gallery I check weekly is <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com/">Best Web Gallery</a>. It really is nice to see the wide ranges of design types being used.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>I don't really think I have much else to say. I think I got everything about me down. I'm not always one for giving out information online, but I don't mind giving out a little about me.</p>

        <p>MyBB 1.4.10 is now available on the MyBB website and is a general maintenance release.</p>
<p>This release fixes several reported issues with version released since 1.4.8 causing some incorrect functionality of MyBB. These bugs have been fixed to provide a more stable version of MyBB for public use.</p>
<h4><strong>What's added/changed in this version?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>MyBB 1.4.10 is now compatible with PHP 5.3.</li>
<li>Server Statistics are now sent to MyBB at the end of installation for analytical purposes. This is of course anonymous, no confidential information is sent, and you may easily opt out if you wish.</li>
<li>... many other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>This release has been tested by our Software Quality Assurance group.</p>
<p>Information on upgrading, template changes and language changes can be found in the posts below.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-size:x-larger;"><strong>Please note, that you need to run the upgrade script for this version.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;"><strong>This is so the templates may be updated.</strong></span><br />
<i>There are <strong>no</strong> database schema changes in this version.</i></p>
<h4><strong>Upgrading from the 1.4 series</strong></h4>
<p>When upgrading from 1.4.9, you will not lose any custom themes, plugins or language packs which you may have installed.</p>
<p>Follow the general <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading" target="_blank" title="View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process. You may download a ZIP archive of changed files here:</p>
<p><a href="http://mybboard.net/download/112">changed_files_1410.zip</a></p>
<p><strong>You must then check for modified templates using the instructions below.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Upgrading from other versions</strong></h4>
<p>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2 then you will lose your custom themes, templates and language packs due to the number of changes between your version and the 1.2 series.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board.</strong></span> This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.</p>
<p>Follow the general <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading" target="_blank" title="View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.</p>

<h4><strong>Theme and template changes</strong></h4>
<p>Using the "Find Updated" link under the "Templates" page in the Admin CP you can find a list of the templates that have changed in this release that you've got one or more custom copies of.</p>
<p>After identifying changed templates using the tool you can either revert your custom template to the default (delete it) or use the "diff" tool to perform a difference analysis on your custom template and the default.</p>
<p>"Revert required" indicates that for this template to work correctly with MyBB 1.4.8 you'll either need to revert it to the default or modify your custom template to include the changes in the default. If a revert is not required your custom version of the template should work perfectly fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Template changes</strong></h4>
<p>Since MyBB 1.4.8 the following templates have had changes to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>member_register_customfield</li>
<li>posticons</li>
<li>postbit_ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>* <span style="color:red;">Red represents the template must be updated or reverted to fix security problems</span></p>
<h4><strong>Language file changes</strong></h4>
<p>Since MyBB 1.4.8 the following language files have had changes to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>datahandler_user.lang.php</li>
</ul>
<p>Either update your language packs to include the changes in these files or revert to the standard English language pack.</p>
<h4><strong>Plugins</strong></h4>
<p>Most of your MyBB 1.4.x plugins will work correctly with 1.4.10 without any updates.</p>
<hr />
<h1><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANT Update: December 8th, 2009</span></h1>
<p>Due to a regression introduced by a change between MyBB 1.4.9 and MyBB 1.4.10 if you downloaded the MyBB 1.4.10 package or update before December 7th, 2009, we are releasing a patch to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Open /admin/modules/style/templates.php and find near line 531:</p>
<p><em><code>// Only allow users to move non-default templates to stop them from being able to delete it!<br />
if($template['sid'] == "-2")<br />
{<br />
	echo $form-&gt;generate_hidden_field("sid", "-2");<br />
}<br />
else<br />
{<br />
	$form_container-&gt;output_row($lang-&gt;template_set, $lang-&gt;template_set_desc, $form-&gt;generate_select_box('sid', $template_sets, $sid));<br />
}</code></em></p>
<p>and replace with:</p>
<p><em><code>// Force users to save the default template to a specific set, rather than the "global" templates - where they can delete it<br />
if($template['sid'] == "-2")<br />
{<br />
	unset($template_sets[-1]);<br />
}</p>
<p>$form_container-&gt;output_row($lang-&gt;template_set, $lang-&gt;template_set_desc, $form-&gt;generate_select_box('sid', $template_sets, $sid));</code></em></p>
<p>We apologize for this inconvenience!</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>As part of our recent (and emergency) server migration, we've just finished restructuring our development server (that hosts the <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/">MyBB Development Portal</a> and Subversion repositories). As a result, if you're checking out and working with our Subversion repositories, please be aware that the URLs for doing so have changed.</p>
<p>The new official Subversion repositories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyBB - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Merge System - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Modifications - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've already checked out a copy of MyBB using Subversion, you can switch your local copy to the new URL using the following command:<br />
<code>svn switch --relocate http://dev.mybboard.net/svn/mybb/ http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb</code></p>
<p><strong>Please note that the old Subversion URLs will continue to work for the majority of users the time being.</strong> However, if you're running Mac OS X, you'll need to switch to the new URLs due to a bug with the Subversion client that ships with Mac OS X.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-2165.html">Ryan Gordon</a> was second to answer your questions, he must have thought they were bugs cause he had the answers the day after me asking them.</p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m Ryan Gordon, and I live in the Bay Area of California, USA. I’ve been on the MyBB team since April 2006, back in the days of MyBB 1.1. I’m currently an intern for a SQA position during my summers, and school during the school year. In my other time I run various websites, I work with my Robotics Club (helping get financing &amp; partners, doing programming and occasionally mechanical or electrical jobs), and I also do some freelance and for-fun coding. I love playing soccer, and have played soccer for most of my life. In my free time I love talking and hanging out with friends, joking, gaming, and going to the movies.</p>
<h4>Does your brother ever annoy you when you're programming MyBB?</h4>
<p>All the time :(</p>
<h4>What's it like helping administrate the largest known MyBB forum, with over 4 million posts (NCAABBS)?</h4>
<p>It's definitely interesting. You learn a lot of what it takes to run an operation that big in terms of programming optimizations, security, and stability as well as managing it well.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>I love playing soccer in my spare time. I also am on a robotics club, and who would've guessed? I'm the main programmer.</p>
<h4>How does an average day look for you?</h4>
<p>Weekdays I wake up at 8:00am and get into work by 9:30am. I get off work at 5:00pm and drive myself through commute traffic back to home. At around 6:00pm I have my dinner and turn on the computer. During the next few hours, I try to enjoy a TV show or two on Hulu.com and talk to friends. Otherwise I am on the MyBB Community forums and my other various projects to check up on and do my job. I end up going to sleep anywhere between 10pm and 3am.<br />
Weekends usually call for some relaxing, going to the movies or hanging out with friends, chores, et cetera. Of course, during the school year, my days are filled with assignments.</p>
<h4>What is your favorite book?</h4>
<p>I must admit, I was raised a Harry Potter fan. My closet however is filled with programming books, some half read, some my bibles, some I've scanned over. The Dan Brown books are also among my favorites.</p>
<h4>What feature have you always wanted in MyBB but has not yet been included?</h4>
<p>Automatic updates. That would be killer =) Will definitely be in MyBB 2.0</p>
<h4>What is your favorite language, both programming and real languages?</h4>
<p>PHP is definitely the language for me. English is also my favorite real language.</p>
<h4>Is MyBB your only developing project on the internet or are you involved in others?</h4>
<p>I do periodic work for clients (creating a website here and there), I also have my own RCT3 Fansite that I have co-owned and have continued to run for 4 years.</p>
<h4>What initially attracted you to MyBB?</h4>
<p>My first RCT3 Fansite ran a phpBB 2 forum. Me and the owner decided we wanted something with a little more functionality. At the same time, I had known and had been friends with Justin S., our now Lead Designer, who also ran a RCT3 Fansite and was looking for a better forum to replace phpBB 2 with. He found MyBB, and he linked me to it. It was definately a much better choice and we chose it. At the time this was going on, I was learning the basic web programming languages, including PHP. I put my PHP skills to the test by first creating plugins and soon after, I got hooked.</p>
<h4>What is the most trouble you've ever been in?</h4>
<p>That's a hard question to answer. I would say some of the fights and tantrums me and my brother would use to have, would get us in lots of trouble.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>I would say, owning and creating a theme park on the ranks of Disneyland/Great America has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<h4>Anything else you want to add?</h4>
<p>Just a few interesting facts about me I guess:<br />
I hate California weather because I like it when it rains - It is peaceful, cleansing, and something different then the norm.<br />
I program best at the late hours of the night, because I am not bothered by noises, people or issues much; it allows me to focus and get things done.<br />
I have a knack for making people laugh with my jokes when I'm not in a working environment and I love to make people smile.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1830.html">Justin S.</a> is the first team member to have a go at answering questions, so be nice to him.</p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m Justin, and I live in Central Ohio, USA. I’ve been on the MyBB team since April 2006, back in the days of MyBB 1.1. I’m currently a junior in high school. In my free time, I run a roller coaster simulator fansite called <a href="http://rctgo.net">RCTgo</a>, and also do some web design through my portfolio, <a href="http://bellomandesign.com/">Belloman Design</a>. I obviously love roller coasters, and I play the alto saxophone in my school’s jazz, concert, and marching bands.</p>
<h4>How did you discover MyBB?</h4>
<p>My experience with forums all began through the RollerCoaster Tycoon community, so it’s fitting that I found MyBB through one of those forums. I already had a bit of experience administrating forums when I discovered MyBB, as I had already created a forum of my own with InvisionFree. Anyway, at some point I had found a forum of Sebar’s (a notable member of the RCT community), which was running MyBB. I knew a bit about forum softwares at that point – notably vB, IPB, and phpBB – but had never heard of MyBB.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to check out the website, downloaded a copy of MyBB and installed it on my web hosting account. I fell in love instantly – even at PR2, it had just about everything I wanted, and was enough of an incentive to completely start over my forum with it. It’s been nearly four years since I discovered MyBB and I’m still in love with it.</p>
<h4>Describe some of the roles you have taken on in the MyBB team</h4>
<p>When I first became a member of the MyBB team, I was added alongside Ryan Gordon as one of the official MyBB Wiki managers. We were tasked with maintaining the wiki, ensuring all of the articles were of a high quality, and that all of the appropriate articles were there.</p>
<p>At some point, I was asked to redesign the MyBB website. A redesign had already been in progress, but we (the team) felt that it could use a bit of a “refresh.” I guess you could say that is where I began my role as designer.</p>
<p>For MyBB 1.4, I created the layouts for countless pages in the new MyBB Admin CP. I’d say roughly two-thirds of the layouts were done by me in HTML mockups. At the same time, I also wrote almost all of the wiki documentation for the new features and changes in MyBB 1.4, most noticeably rewriting nearly all of the wiki articles for the Admin CP.</p>
<p>Today, my roles are MyBB Lead Designer and Wiki Lead. I’m responsible for almost every new layout that goes into MyBB, as well as (on the side) making sure the Wiki is up to date and being well maintained.</p>
<h4>Which program/tool do you enjoy using the most while designing the new layout and graphics for MyBB?</h4>
<p>Pencil and paper go a long way when initially mocking up layouts. With an eraser in hand, I can easily brainstorm how I want a page laid out, as it often takes a bit of time to get something that’s “just right.” Another great thing about paper mockups is that they’re obviously strictly layout, not theme, which I think is important in early stages.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I’ve been using a program called <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq Mockups</a>, which is a fantastic tool that tries to imitate pencil and paper mockups. It’s really easy to get things looking exactly how I want them, and I think I’m going to be using it quite a bit more in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some pencil mockups that Justin did for 1.4.</p>

</div>
<h4 style="clear:both;">How much time do you spend designing MyBB? Describe the process of being a designer of MyBB.</h4>
<p>When I’m designing a new layout for MyBB, I’ll often start with a paper sketch or a mockup in Balsamiq Mockups, experimenting and fine tuning the layout to exactly how I think it should be. At this point, I’ll usually show it to Ryan Gordon, and finally to the rest of the MyBB staff for input. Once a decent amount of input has been received, I’ll typically open up a text editor and begin creating an HTML mockup, which gives the developers a clear picture of how I envision the layout to look. I’ll then do the same: show it to Ryan Gordon and finally to the rest of the staff for review. Finally, a developer will eventually come in and commit the feature, based on the mockups I created.</p>
<p>I do not keep track of how much time I spend on any particular design or on designing MyBB in general. I do it whenever I have free time.</p>
<h4>What feature did you want MyBB to have that was never included?</h4>
<p>Soft delete. As someone who is paranoid about deleting things, I would love to have the option to “delete” posts without actually deleting them. A lot of people suggest to simply unapprove posts that you want to keep but not delete, but that doesn’t work too well: it clutters up the moderation queue, and isn’t really what I consider unapproved posts to be for.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Roller coasters, web design, architecture, band, and reading.</p>
<h4>What do you have for breakfast each day?</h4>
<p>I typically eat some combination of bagels, muffins, waffles, pancakes, French toast, and yogurt. I hardly ever skip breakfast.</p>
<h4>What was the meaning behind your former username, Belloman?</h4>
<p>I’m afraid I’m not going to answer this question. I always like to keep a few secrets about myself.</p>
<h4>What was your favorite nursery rhyme?</h4>
<p>I’m not sure if this is the proper title or if it was my favorite, but “It’s raining, it’s pouring,” comes to mind.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>Architecture. I have always been in love with buildings and maps, and I think something related to architecture or engineering is a perfect fit for my interests.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>Being on the MyBB team has truly been a life-changing experience, and I don’t think I will ever regret joining the team. I’m also really looking forward to seeing what the future holds for MyBB – whatever it is, I’m sure it’ll be great!</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>For the past seven years, MyBB has had an ever-growing and changing community, and through it all the "MyBB Group" itself is still a small set of dedicated individuals. Up until now MyBB has been developed in a relatively private fashion.  Recently, it seems as the tides have turned; we have realized that you want more: you want the cutting edge, you want to be more a part of the "Real MyBB", and you want the best free forum software that free can buy. We've listened to your advice, and we are now pleased to announce the availability of public access to our development site, including access to the latest and greatest cutting edge MyBB!</p>
<h4>What does this mean for you?</h4>
<p>With the community more closely involved with MyBB's development, we will be able to ensure releases are more stable and you will be able to get access to the latest bug fixes and features. We hope that by making our development site available and open to the public that more people will take an interest in MyBB and get involved!</p>
<h4>How exactly do you get access?</h4>
<p>The link to the development site is <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/">http://dev.mybboard.net/</a>. This will give you direct access to our MyBB 1.4 repository, MyBB 1.6 repository including all the latest features and fixes. This will also be where you report bugs with MyBB and its related projects. We have generated detailed information on our Wiki's revamped Development section: <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Development">http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Development</a>. The Development section will be the best place to ask your questions and concerns regarding the site, SVN access, coding standards, and other procedures.</p>
<p>Please note that the MyBB group officially supports only the latest release series, as of writing, MyBB 1.4.x.  Although you have access to the latest MyBB 1.6.x code, there may be partially-committed features which are broken.  We do not recommend using the development "trunk" on production forums, and they will <strong>NOT </strong>be supported by the support staff here.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>MyBB 1.4.8 is now available on the MyBB website and is a general maintenance and security release.</p>
<p>This release fixes several reported issues with version released since 1.4.6 causing some incorrect functionality of MyBB. These bugs have been fixed to provide a more stable version of MyBB for public use.</p>
<h4><strong>What's added/changed in this version?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>One Low XSS Vulnerability fixed in the Archive - This is tagged as low because it requires moderator permissions. This vulnerability was discovered and reported by frostschutz.</li>
<li>One Medium XSS vulnerabilities fixed in Attachments - This vulnerability was reported by frostschutz.<br /><i>Please note that this patch will remove the ability to open some types of attachments directly in your browser (e.g. QuickTime Movies), and will instead ask you to download them.</i></li>
<li>... Several other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>This release has been tested by our Software Quality Assurance group.</p>
<h4><strong>MyBB 1.4.7 to MyBB 1.4.8 Patch</strong></h4>
<p>This patch is only for users running MyBB 1.4.7. If you are running any other version of the MyBB 1.4 series then please download MyBB 1.4.8 from the MyBB site and update to it.</p>
<p>If you wish to manually patch your board please download "mybb_1407_patches.txt" and follow the instructions in that file.</p>
<p><a href="http://mybboard.net/download/105">mybb_1407_patches.txt</a></p>
<p><strong>The manual patch set instructions only fixes the security vulnerabilities and is only made available to temporarily secure your forum until you have time to run the complete upgrade.</strong></p>
<p>Information on upgrading, template changes and language changes can be found in the posts below.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;font-size:x-larger;"><strong>Please note, that you need to run the upgrade script for this version.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:red;"><strong>This is so the templates may be updated.</strong></span><br />
<i>There are <strong>no</strong> database schema changes in this version.</i></p>
<h4><strong>Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities</strong></h4>
<p>If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.</p>
<p>As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the Contact Us page.</p>
<h4><strong>MyBB 1.2.14 Patch</strong></h4>
<p>Users running MyBB 1.2.14 or any previous release of the MyBB 1.2 series may use the same manual instructions provided in the "mybb_1407_patches.txt" attachment (excluding the version change).</p>
<h4><strong>Upgrading from the 1.4 series</strong></h4>
<p>When upgrading from 1.4.7, you will not lose any custom themes, plugins or language packs which you may have installed.</p>
<p>Follow the general <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading" target="_blank" title="View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process. You may download a ZIP archive of changed files here:</p>
<p><a href="http://mybboard.net/download/106">changed_files_1408.zip</a></p>
<p><strong>You must then check for modified templates using the instructions below.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Upgrading from other versions</strong></h4>
<p>If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 1.2 then you will lose your custom themes, templates and language packs due to the number of changes between your version and the 1.2 series.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board.</strong></span> This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.</p>
<p>Follow the general <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading" target="_blank" title="View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.</p>

<h4><strong>Theme and template changes</strong></h4>
<p>Using the "Find Updated" link under the "Templates" page in the Admin CP you can find a list of the templates that have changed in this release that you've got one or more custom copies of.</p>
<p>After identifying changed templates using the tool you can either revert your custom template to the default (delete it) or use the "diff" tool to perform a difference analysis on your custom template and the default.</p>
<p>"Revert required" indicates that for this template to work correctly with MyBB 1.4.8 you'll either need to revert it to the default or modify your custom template to include the changes in the default. If a revert is not required your custom version of the template should work perfectly fine.</p>
<h4><strong>Template changes</strong></h4>
<p>Since MyBB 1.4.6 the following templates have had changes to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>modcp_ipsearch_result</li>

<p>* <span style="color:red;">Red represents the template must be updated or reverted to fix security problems</span></p>
<h4><strong>Language file changes</strong></h4>
<p>Since MyBB 1.4.6 the following language files have had changes to them:</p>

<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">admin/</span>
<ul>
<li>config_spiders.lang.php
				</li>

<p>Either update your language packs to include the changes in these files or revert to the standard English language pack.</p>

<h4>Returning and new staff members</h4>
<p>Firstly, we welcome back <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1428.html">nickman</a>. nickman was with us previously on the development team and has now offered to rejoin us on the SQA team.

<p>Please also welcome <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17942.html">Joshua Mayer</a>. Joshua is very active and has been a great help to members who request various forms of support.</p>
<h4>Staff member leaves</h4>
<p>Today we say goodbye to <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1923.html">Sergio Montoya</a> who has been a developer with us for the past year. He leaves us to focus more on his personal and real life. We hope you join us in wishing him the best of luck in his future.  <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17470.html">Sayakb</a> has been moved to the development team to fill Sergio's place.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>We've been reasonably quiet between the release of MyBB 1.4.4 and 1.4.5, but that doesn't mean that nothing has been going on behind the scenes. This blog post aims to outline some of what has been going on at MyBB during the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks you may have noticed a few changes with our current staff, whether it was removal of staff or a change of position. Some changes may not even be noticeable by you but I'll outline them all anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chris Boulton</strong><br />
Due to time restraints placed on Chris by work, Chris was finding it difficult to find a balance between work and play whilst including MyBB and therefore has shifted some of the lower priority, day-to-date responsibilities of product management to Dennis Tsang. To be clear, Chris will still be involved in the MyBB project and will be overseeing the project from an executive aspect.</li>
<li><strong>Dennis Tsang</strong><br />
Dennis will be taking on more of the the day-to-day operations and administrative tasks that Chris Boulton used to do.</li>
<li><strong>destroyer (Kevin Camps)</strong><br />
Kevin will take on some content management duties, this includes the MyBB website, MyBB Wiki, etc. Kevin will also be partly responsible for approving themes, plugins and resources to the Mods section of the MyBB site and help out coordinating the translations with Tochjo.</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Loos</strong><br />
Ryan has made the move from a Support Team member to a Public Relations Liaison. With this new title, Ryan will be responsible for resolving community issues, updating the blog, making <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> updates from the <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBB">MyBB Twitter account</a>, seeking new talent to take up positions on the team, in future betas and in the Mentor group and educating other communities on MyBB if their views are a little off.</li>
<li><strong>Justin S.</strong><br />
Justin is now in the developers' group although he will still maintain the Wiki and continue his design work. He was always a design developer on the team, so the title change just reflects his correct role, although he will be performing all of the same duties as he did before.</li>
<li><strong>Tomm M</strong><br />
Tom's moved into a developer's position from his old role as a Support Team member. He's shown a good understanding of how MyBB's insides work during his time on the team and has already taken on a good portion of development for MyBB 1.6.</li>
<li><strong>Max Marze</strong><br />
Max too has become a developer and will be working towards getting the new version of the MyBB Merge System out. Specifically, he will help by writing unit testing scripts to ensure that the Merge System, when released in the future, will not have as many problems as in previous releases.</li>
<li><strong>MattRogowski </strong><br />
Matt, though still a part of the Support Team, will also be partly responsible for approving themes, plugins and resources to the Mods section of the MyBB site.</li>
<li><strong>sayakb</strong><br />
Sayak has offered to come on board as an SQA Team member. He's shown a strong knowledge of MyBB by developing plugins, which can be found at the KDE forums, and testing new MyBB releases for compatibility with the KDE forums.</li>
<li><strong>LegosJedi</strong><br />
We're saying goodbye to LegosJedi who has left us due to time constraints. We wish LegosJedi best of luck on his future endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Tom Loveric</strong><br />
Tom has also decided to head his own direction with a custom CMS he is building. We wish him the best of luck in his future and with his CMS.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recruiting New Support Staff</h4>
<p>We're always looking out for new potential. If you want to be on the MyBB Team, you just have to show:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are dedicated and active to the project</li>
<li>You speak English very well and have good communication skills</li>
<li>You have good knowledge of how MyBB works and in the position you want to take up</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't feel like we’re noticing you it's probably just because we're too busy making the next version of MyBB! So just send us an email via our <a href="http://mybboard.net/contact">contact form</a> with "Available Team Member Position" as the subject. <b>Include your forum username.</b> Remember though, your chances are considerably increased if you stand out with the three suggestions listed above.</p>
<h4>SQA Team Updates</h4>
<p>You might have also noticed the creation of the SQA Team (Software Quality Assurance) right after the release of 1.4.4 due to the amount of problems that were reported after its release. SQA has been able to confirm 95% of fixes are working and don't cause any regressions that are written by our developers and put into our code base. Among those that they confirmed, SQA was able to find and report dozens of regressions over the course of the entire MyBB 1.4.5 development in over 100 bugs, optimizations, and tweaks. As such, SQA has been a huge success for the MyBB Group and in turn creates much more stable releases for you. We are continuing to perfect the new SQA Team and implement processes that will eliminate preventable issues from the get-go.</p>

        <h4>Discontinuation of support for 1.2 series</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4 has been out for over 8 months. During this time we have had a security audit done and we believe that the 1.4 series is the safest yet. So upgrading should not worry you one bit.<br />
When we first released 1.4 we only planned to continue support for 6 months but continued support due to the sizeable amount of people that still used the 1.2 series.</p>
<p><b>Support for the 1.2 series will end on June 1st, 2009</b> - making it 9 months of support after the release of the 1.4 series.<br />
For those of you who are still operating boards with 1.2 we urge you to upgrade to the latest 1.4 release and seek help if needed before June 1st.</p>
<p>Some links that may be of use to you:<br />
<a href="http://www.mybboard.net/downloads">http://www.mybboard.net/downloads</a> - To obtain the latest MyBB release<br />
<a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Database_Backup">[Wiki: Database_Backup]</a> - Always important if something goes wrong. Also be sure to backup all your files.<br />
<a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> - Standard upgrading procedure details.</p>
<p>After June 1st, 2009, the 1.2 support forums will be moved to the read-only archive.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we will still provide vulnerability patches for the 1.2 series until December 31st, 2009.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Greetings to all,</p>
<p>As we continue to try and reach out to the community with more information on our progress, development, et cetera, this blog post is here to inform you on our current plans for MyBB 1.4, MyBB 1.6, and MyBB 2.0. We are not going to be giving in-depth information away on MyBB 1.6 or 2.0 until they near completion but I would like to draw a general outline and sum up some information that has been spread across the internet.</p>
<h4>MyBB 1.4.5</h4>
<p>Work is currently going to completing MyBB 1.4.5. It will contain over 100 various fixes, and include performance and stability improvements among other things. We want to put MyBB 1.4.5 through a 2-week beta testing phase before we release it to the general public. This is done in order to ensure we minimize any regressions from changes that have been made to the code since MyBB 1.4.4 and so you can have a smooth transition upgrading from MyBB 1.4.4 to MyBB 1.4.5.</p>
<h4>MyBB 1.6</h4>
<p>We are steadily and diligently working on development for MyBB 1.6. There have been 17 features/improvements officially "completed" and are in the process of Quality Analysis. We have several more near completion. You won't be seeing any <i>huge</i> changes in MyBB 1.6 and we have taken steps to ensure that when MyBB 1.6 is officially released it will be a stable release. This is done so we can keep the impact on theme creators and plugin and mod authors down to a minimal level. This will lead to a smooth transition between MyBB 1.4 and MyBB 1.6 and I'm looking towards at least 60% of all plugins should still work with MyBB 1.6 with minimal changes (essentially just the "compatibility" indicator updated for most).</p>
<h4>MyBB 2.0</h4>
<p>We have been brainstorming, sharing ideas, sharing mockups, etc for the past few months. We will probably be brainstorming and trying new ideas for MyBB 2.0 for the most part all the way up to the general testing of MyBB 1.6 and then we will shift gears to MyBB 2.0.</p>
<p>We hope everyone enjoys this small update on our development and future plans. We will continue to space out these updates during our normal development cycles to keep you informed on the going-ons of MyBB. </p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Ryan Gordon and I am the lead developer of MyBB and the MyBB Merge System. This blog post is here to inform the community members on some of the caveats and successes of the MyBB Merge System.</p>
<p>Let me first introduce a bit of history on the MyBB Merge System. It has been in development for quite a while - before MyBB 1.2's release - and it hasn't officially reached a "stable" tag in its development. The MyBB Merge System is quite a revolutionary product in terms of the abilities it provides to those who use it. Many people don't realize the full potential or mistakenly think that the MyBB Merge System is used to virtually "link" two forums together, when in fact the Merge System actually takes data from any supported forum software and combines it with your current forum. This is where things start to get interesting.</p>
<p>So let's get straight to the point- Because of the unique nature of the Merge System, design and development is a grueling process. We have been able to work through most of the problems but several issues have plagued us over the course of its development:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Testing</em> - It is a long enduring process to replicate a bug report, that may not have been caused by the Merge System in the first place.  This is compounded by the fact we are also testing with different forum systems with which we are not familiar.</li>
<li><em>Complexity</em> - The actual process of converting data from one forum to another is very easy, which is why most forum software choose to go down that path. However, the process of being able to <em>merge</em> two existing forums into one is a much more complex process. In terms of manpower, this has greatly impacted our development abilities for the Merge System.</li>
<li><em>Mainstream Availability</em> - Many people shy away from testing the Merge System because of the "<acronym title="Release Candidate">RC</acronym>" or "Beta" tags attached to it. Unfortunately, we haven't gotten many people to come forth and test it for that reason and in turn it just creates a catch-22. If we can't get people to test it, then it is difficult for us to move forward. On the flip side, people don't want to test it unless we've completed development to a "stable" point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing has been a problem since the beginning and the Merge System has gone through 3-4 rewrites because of it. The process of testing and reproducing in its current state is cruel to us developers for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Information </em>- We need very specific information to reproduce problems, which can be sometimes hard to procure from users. And when we get that information we have to determine whether it was caused by the Merge System, the other forum system, or by a modification or plugin that may have skewed with the database data.</li>
<li><em>Time </em>- The MyBB Merge System is a staircase in a high rise. You have to work your way up from Level A all the way through Level Z to complete the merge. At any point in time, a problem could have happened. If we are able to reproduce the problem, then we have to look at the code to see if there is a way to fix it. If the developers were able to come up with a fix, then we have to test the Merge System again. If the fix didn't work then we're back to square 2 and we have to repeat the process. This means that we are at minimum required to run the Merge System twice on our test data, and usually it's more than that.</li>
<li><em>Reproduction </em>- In the case that we weren't able to reproduce the problem then we have to go back to square 1 and figure out what more information we need or in some cases, direct access to the test data in the live environment where the problem originally happened. This leads us to our last reason.</li>
<li><em>Communication </em>- Some of the time users report their problems and never come back because the merge is already completed into their forum and most problems are usually already fixable with a bit of manual work. This makes it really frustrating when we're trying to reproduce and diagnose problems reported by users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complexity has also been a large problem for our developers and one of the reasons progress has been so slow. Not only do we have to perform balancing acts between MyBB and the Merge System, we also have to deal with the complexity of the Merge System when testing and reproducing issues and general updates overall.</p>
<p>Lastly, mainstream availability has been a big issue with the Merge System. The market for a Merge System is a lot smaller then the market of MyBB and it's a one-time-use program, so people tend to use it, report their problems, and never need to come back to it. </p>
<p>For the reasons above, we have started looking into automated methods of testing code.  One solution we are currently trying is Unit Testing, a type of testing used in SQA departments.  In fact, I am current about half way through reworking the Merge System to support Unit Testing. </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">Unit testing</a> is a form of quality assurance where small blocks of a software module such as a single function are tested to ensure that by themselves their outputs correspond correctly to given test inputs.  At a click of a button, a developer or tester can run a set of tests and see the results quite simply as a "pass" or "fail" for each of the test cases.  This will help us quickly identify any "broken" components which may have been caused by the latest changes, and from which component the problem is in.</p>
<p>Once we have unit testing in place, a large majority of problems we would be able to identify and resolve before it is ever released to the public and in turn we won't need to rely as much on the public to test the Merge System.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this article.</p>
