<h4>Discontinuation of support for 1.2 series</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4 has been out for over 8 months. During this time we have had a security audit done and we believe that the 1.4 series is the safest yet. So upgrading should not worry you one bit.<br />
When we first released 1.4 we only planned to continue support for 6 months but continued support due to the sizeable amount of people that still used the 1.2 series.</p>
<p><b>Support for the 1.2 series will end on June 1st, 2009</b> - making it 9 months of support after the release of the 1.4 series.<br />
For those of you who are still operating boards with 1.2 we urge you to upgrade to the latest 1.4 release and seek help if needed before June 1st.</p>

<p>After June 1st, 2009, the 1.2 support forums will be moved to the read-only archive.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we will still provide vulnerability patches for the 1.2 series until December 31st, 2009.</p>
