<p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-6928.html">Imad Jomaa</a> has answered in some detail a few questions.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>As you might have guessed, my name is Imad Jomaa; I happened to be one boring college Student studying to obtain a B.S. degree in Computer Science as well as a degree in Mathematics. I have been working on a start-up Company for two years now with two other partners, hoping we open our doors sometime soon.</p>
<h4>What does your dream job look like?</h4>
<p>I am hoping one of my ideas end up going somewhere. However, to be realistic here, I would love to end up working for a Company who love to innovate and share ideas, and possibly have a catchy mission statement. :P The other side of me wants to work for an organization aiming for global change in education as I believe education is a key factor in anyone's life. Furthermore, whichever of the two directions I end up in, you can call it “my dream job”.</p>
<h4>In your opinion, what is the most useful and simple feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>This is a tough decision since I have recently been using many features in MyBB I thought I would never use. However, to correlate with "most useful", I have to say it is the mark as read feature used on forum icons. I use that feature whenever I am on the forums and it saves a lot of time from entering each individual forum to perform such task.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Despite programming, I love the great outdoors where I am always mesmerized by the vast lands of beauty. I also enjoy expanding my knowledge in wide varieties of subjects ranging from chemistry to biology to marketing and pretty much anything else I find interesting.</p>
<h4>Your favourite piece of hardware/software is... Why?</h4>
<p>I am not necessarily sure if I happened to favor a specific piece of hardware or software over others as each of such have different functions and purposes. However, if we were to compare apples with apples in relation to operating systems I would use for conventional purposes, I would definitely say Microsoft’s Windows since it seems like a complete functional package over others. However, if I happened to be after a great GUI, I would definitely use OSX by Apple since it seems to have that aspect well laid out.</p>
<h4>What are some of your pet hates?</h4>
<p>This is another tough question to answer, but I would say the usage of foul language. The usage of such language seems ever increasing especially with young children. It seems as if it became an ongoing trend whether they understand it or not, or whether it is appropriate or not; thus it definitely annoys me.</p>
<h4>Is there a feature you've come up with (or seen elsewhere) that you would like to see implemented into MyBB one day? What is it and why would it be good for MyBB?</h4>
<p>One of the interesting projects I have seen for security CAPTCHA is dragging and dropping objects. I found it very intuitive to have your potential users be able to bypass the sometimes-unreadable characters to something simple and easy to use. The whole idea behind it is asking your user to drag a certain shape from a pool of them to the right – it is simple, intuitive and depending on how it is developed, secure from today’s and possibly future bots.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite TV series?</h4>
<p>I definitely say it has to be the Mythbusters TV series since they put popular myths to the test and in the end, finally clear up some unanswered questions in an entertaining form.</p>
<h4>What do you enjoy most about your life?</h4>
<p>I think it has to be the motivation in me that always wants me to expand my knowledge into many categories which gives me a better understanding of many aspects of today’s world.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>None at all, I think the nine questions asked covered everything I wanted to mention. :)</p>
