<li><strong>Adding support for 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding in MySQL</strong>When MySQL 5.5.3 or above is used a new option to convert the tables to 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding is available in the "UTF-8 Conversion" page in the Admin Control Panel. This allows to store unicode characters with 4 bytes. If you don't know what we are talking about you probably don't need it. PgSQL and SQLite can store such characters by default.</li>
