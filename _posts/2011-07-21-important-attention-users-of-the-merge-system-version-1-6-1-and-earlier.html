<p>If you've used the MyBB Merge System v1.6.1 or earlier please download the  file attached <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-99432.html" target="_blank">here</a>, upload it to your forum root, and run it by going to http://yourdomain.com/yourforumpath/icr.php for security purposes.</p>
<p>The reason for this is a potential security breach related to the "old db" password being stored in the datacache in plaintext form. Thanks goes to euantor &amp; Malcolm for reporting this.</p>
