<p>Following the <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2015/09/07/mybb-1-8-6-1-6-18-merge-system-1-8-6-release/">recent postponement</a>, <strong>the official support for the MyBB 1.6 series has ended as of 1st October 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-138.html">1.6 Support forums</a> have been archived and we will no longer provide assistance regarding the 1.6 series (that does not include the 1.8 upgrading process).</p>
<p>No further maintenance and security releases or updates will be provided for that branch.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend all users who still operate 1.6 boards to upgrade them as soon as possible. Detailed information on performing upgrades can be found in our <a title="Upgrade - MyBB Documentation" href="http://docs.mybb.com/1.8/install/upgrade/">upgrade instructions</a>. The MyBB Team and the Community can provide further advice on our <a title="MyBB Community Forums" href="http://community.mybb.com/">support forums</a>.</p>
