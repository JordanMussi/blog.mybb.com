<h4>MyBB 1.4 end of life</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.6 was released almost 8 months ago and since then has proven to be stable and secure. Therefore we will be concluding maintenanceÂ and support for the MyBB 1.4 series, and we encourage everyone who has not already done so to upgrade to MyBB 1.6 as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The end of life date for MyBB 1.4 will be the 1st of July, 2011.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">After this date:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not be offering official support for MyBB 1.4</li>
<li>There will be no further maintenance or security releases for the 1.4 series</li>
<li>The 1.4 support forums will be closed and archived</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require information on how to upgrade please consult our <a href="http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading">upgrade instructions</a>, if you need further support please visit the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/">support forums</a>.</p>
