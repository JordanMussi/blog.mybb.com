<p>Greetings all. Today we've got a little update on the MyBB staff.</p>
<h4>Returning and new staff members</h4>
<p>Firstly, we welcome back <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1428.html">nickman</a>. nickman was with us previously on the development team and has now offered to rejoin us on the SQA team. When he was on the developers' team he worked mainly on bug fixes, and SQA is all about bug fixes and offering possible fixes. Please make him feel welcome again.</p>
<p>Please also welcome <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17942.html">Joshua Mayer</a>. Joshua is very active and has been a great help to members who request various forms of support.</p>
<h4>Staff member leaves</h4>
<p>Today we say goodbye to <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1923.html">Sergio Montoya</a> who has been a developer with us for the past year. He leaves us to focus more on his personal and real life. We hope you join us in wishing him the best of luck in his future.Â  <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17470.html">Sayakb</a> has been moved to the development team to fill Sergio's place.</p>
