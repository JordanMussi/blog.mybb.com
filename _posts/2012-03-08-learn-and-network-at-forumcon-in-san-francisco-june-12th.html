<p>We don’t come across many events that are tailored exclusively to the forum industry, however we are pleased to announce our involvement with ForumCon.  ForumCon is an annual event was launched just a few years ago with the goal of bringing together the industry’s leading forum owners and experts to discuss growth, management, and monetization strategies for forums.</p>
<p>This years I’m pleased to announce that MyBB will be among a select group of media partners who will have a presence at the show.  We are hoping to have at least two team members attending, and we may have a couple of tickets to give away to lucky members of the community.</p>
<p><strong>Key Details</strong><br />
ForumCon SF will take place on June 12th at the Hotel Kabuki in the heart of downtown San Francisco. The event will kick off at 9am and conclude with a cocktail hour for networking / conversation at a restaurant / lounge nearby.</p>
