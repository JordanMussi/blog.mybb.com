<p>The MyBB Group is proud to release the first public beta of MyBB 1.6.  There are over <a title="MyBB 1.6 Feature List" href="http://dev.mybboard.net/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=1" target="_self">48 new features</a> some of which we have featured in two of our previous blog postings (sneak previews: <a title="MyBB 1.6 Sneak Preview Part 1" href="http://blog.mybboard.net/2010/01/01/mybb-16-sneak-preview-part-1/">part 1</a>, <a title="MyBB 1.6 Sneak Preview Part 2" href="http://blog.mybboard.net/2010/01/25/mybb-1-6-sneak-preview-part-2/">part 2</a>).  In addition, there are a number of improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>MyBB 1.6 aims to provide a number of fresh new features to the 1.4.x code base.  We had backward compatibility in mind, and so most themes and modifications designed for 1.4.x should work with 1.6 with minimal changes.</p>
<h4>Beta software</h4>
<p>As this is still beta software, we expect there are going to be bugs, anomalies and other related issues.  Please report any bugs in our <a title="MyBB Development Site" href="http://dev.mybboard.net/projects/mybb/issues">development tracker</a>, with all the information you may find relevant (error verbatim, reproduction procedure, server software, browser, etc), and please search before posting.  At this time we do not recommend running this on a production forum.  It is highly recommended that you create backups of your files and database before attempting to use MyBB 1.6.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>The support team will be providing limited official support for the beta software.  Our concentration for support will still be on our stable series, 1.4.x, so please be patient.  As usual, we can only provide support for assistance in using MyBB's features.  We cannot provide support for customizations including plugins, modifications, and themes.</p>
<h4>Download and further information</h4>
<p>The MyBB 1.6 Beta can be <a title="MyBB 1.6 Beta Download" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-69638.html" target="_self">downloaded here</a>.  Please read our <a title="MyBB 1.6 FAQ" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-69672.html">1.6 FAQ</a> as well.</p>
