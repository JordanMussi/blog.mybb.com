<p>We have many helpful members at MyBB's community forums, and it's great when one of them is willing to join the MyBB team.</p>
<h4>Welcome our newest staff member</h4>
<p>Kieran, more commonly known to you as <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-15525.html">Polarbear541</a>, will be joining the Support Team. He's been a MyBB user since the launch of 1.4 and is comfortable with the way it works and in customising it. Don't be surprised to see him answering questions and pointing people in the right direction. Please make him feel welcome.</p>
<h4>Applications are open</h4>
<p>If you would like to be a part of one of the teams we have here at MyBB (development, support, SQA), please feel free to submit an application about yourself through our <a href="http://www.mybboard.net/contact">contact form</a>.  Tell us a little bit about yourself, what position you would fit into best, and any past experience related to web development.  Good luck!</p>
