<p>MyBB Merge System for 1.6.14 is <a href="http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/merge_1.6.14.zip">now available</a> from the MyBB website and is a maintenance update to the MyBB Merge 1.6 series.</p>
<h4>What's new in this version?</h4>
<ul>
<li> 10 bug fixes (<a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?milestone=1&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">View all</a>) </li>
<li> Version jump to 1.6.14 </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;state=open">Unfixed issues</a></p>
<h4>Future development</h4>
<p>We decided that 1.6.14 will be the last update for the MyBB Merge 1.6 series. At the moment everyone on the team is working on 1.8 so the next Merge Release will be <strong>after</strong> the gold release of 1.8.</p>
<h4>How to help?</h4>
<p>We moved the merge system to <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system">GitHub</a> so everyone is able to help us with the development.<br />
But even if you can't help us with the code, you can still <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-146137.html">send us your database</a> so we can test our modules with different databases.</p>
