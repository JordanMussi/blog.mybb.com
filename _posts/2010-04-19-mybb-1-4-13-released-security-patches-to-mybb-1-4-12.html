<p>MyBB 1.4.13 is now available on the MyBB website and is a patch to MyBB 1.4.12 which introduced two regressions related to the security updates in MyBB 1.4.12.</p>
<p>This release is to ensure that all users on 1.4.12 have the proper security patches applied to their forum.</p>
<p>Thank you to Pirata Nervo and Labrocca for alerting us of these issues and to Stefan Esser for assisting us in a patch for <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/843">Issue #843</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities</strong></h4>
<p>If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.</p>
<p>As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the <a href="http://www.mybboard.net/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<h4><strong>MyBB 1.2.14 Patch</strong></h4>
<p>All users of the 1.2.x series are urged to upgrade to the latest release of MyBB. (1.4.13) MyBB 1.2 is no longer being supported and security updates for the MyBB 1.2 series ceased as of January 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
