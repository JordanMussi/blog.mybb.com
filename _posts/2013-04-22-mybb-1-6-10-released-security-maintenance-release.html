<p>MyBB 1.6.10 is now available from the MyBB website and is a security and maintenance release.</p>
<h4>What's added/changed in this version?</h4>
<p>This release fixes <strong>7 vulnerabilities</strong> and over <strong>95 reported issues</strong> causing incorrect functionality of MyBB. Please be aware that to be able to provide easy to manage updates not all issues have been fixed in this version.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of effort has been put in to MyBB 1.6.10 to fix a myraid of issues with PHP 5.4. This is the main reason why the release has been delayed until now. MyBB 1.6.10 should now be compatible with PHP 5.4 hosts.</p>
