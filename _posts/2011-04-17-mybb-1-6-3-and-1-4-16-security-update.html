<h4>For MyBB 1.6</h4>
<p>The update to MyBB 1.6.3 also upgrades the Prototype and Scriptaculous javascript libraries to their latest versions. This is to help your MyBB forum work properly with Internet Explorer 9.</p>
<p><strong>MyBB 1.6.2 to 1.6.3 Patch</strong><br />
This patch is only for those users running MyBB 1.6.2. If you're running an older version of MyBB then please <a href="http://mybb.com/downloads" target="_blank">download the full version</a> and update to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mybb.com/download/145">1.6.3 changed files</a></p>
<p><strong><em>You are required to run the upgrader for 1.6.3</em></strong>.
