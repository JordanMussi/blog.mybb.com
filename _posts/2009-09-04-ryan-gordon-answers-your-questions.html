<p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-2165.html">Ryan Gordon</a> was second to answer your questions, he must have thought they were bugs cause he had the answers the day after me asking them.</p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m Ryan Gordon, and I live in the Bay Area of California, USA. I’ve been on the MyBB team since April 2006, back in the days of MyBB 1.1. I’m currently an intern for a SQA position during my summers, and school during the school year. In my other time I run various websites, I work with my Robotics Club (helping get financing &amp; partners, doing programming and occasionally mechanical or electrical jobs), and I also do some freelance and for-fun coding. I love playing soccer, and have played soccer for most of my life. In my free time I love talking and hanging out with friends, joking, gaming, and going to the movies.</p>
<h4>Does your brother ever annoy you when you're programming MyBB?</h4>
<p>All the time :(</p>
<h4>What's it like helping administrate the largest known MyBB forum, with over 4 million posts (NCAABBS)?</h4>
<p>It's definitely interesting. You learn a lot of what it takes to run an operation that big in terms of programming optimizations, security, and stability as well as managing it well.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>I love playing soccer in my spare time. I also am on a robotics club, and who would've guessed? I'm the main programmer.</p>
<h4>How does an average day look for you?</h4>
<p>Weekdays I wake up at 8:00am and get into work by 9:30am. I get off work at 5:00pm and drive myself through commute traffic back to home. At around 6:00pm I have my dinner and turn on the computer. During the next few hours, I try to enjoy a TV show or two on Hulu.com and talk to friends. Otherwise I am on the MyBB Community forums and my other various projects to check up on and do my job. I end up going to sleep anywhere between 10pm and 3am.<br />
Weekends usually call for some relaxing, going to the movies or hanging out with friends, chores, et cetera. Of course, during the school year, my days are filled with assignments.</p>
<h4>What is your favorite book?</h4>
<p>I must admit, I was raised a Harry Potter fan. My closet however is filled with programming books, some half read, some my bibles, some I've scanned over. The Dan Brown books are also among my favorites.</p>
<h4>What feature have you always wanted in MyBB but has not yet been included?</h4>
<p>Automatic updates. That would be killer =) Will definitely be in MyBB 2.0</p>
<h4>What is your favorite language, both programming and real languages?</h4>
<p>PHP is definitely the language for me. English is also my favorite real language.</p>
<h4>Is MyBB your only developing project on the internet or are you involved in others?</h4>
<p>I do periodic work for clients (creating a website here and there), I also have my own RCT3 Fansite that I have co-owned and have continued to run for 4 years.</p>
<h4>What initially attracted you to MyBB?</h4>
<p>My first RCT3 Fansite ran a phpBB 2 forum. Me and the owner decided we wanted something with a little more functionality. At the same time, I had known and had been friends with Justin S., our now Lead Designer, who also ran a RCT3 Fansite and was looking for a better forum to replace phpBB 2 with. He found MyBB, and he linked me to it. It was definately a much better choice and we chose it. At the time this was going on, I was learning the basic web programming languages, including PHP. I put my PHP skills to the test by first creating plugins and soon after, I got hooked.</p>
<h4>What is the most trouble you've ever been in?</h4>
<p>That's a hard question to answer. I would say some of the fights and tantrums me and my brother would use to have, would get us in lots of trouble.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>I would say, owning and creating a theme park on the ranks of Disneyland/Great America has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<h4>Anything else you want to add?</h4>
<p>Just a few interesting facts about me I guess:<br />
I hate California weather because I like it when it rains - It is peaceful, cleansing, and something different then the norm.<br />
I program best at the late hours of the night, because I am not bothered by noises, people or issues much; it allows me to focus and get things done.<br />
I have a knack for making people laugh with my jokes when I'm not in a working environment and I love to make people smile.</p>
