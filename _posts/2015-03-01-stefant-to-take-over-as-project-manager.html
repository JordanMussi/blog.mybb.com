<p>I am pleased to announce that StefanT will soon be taking over from me as project manager.</p>
<p>MyBB has been an exciting 7 year journey for me and I've witnessed an enormous amount of progress during my time. The project is still of great significance to me, however I have recently been unable to dedicate the time it deserves, largely due to several great opportunities that have consumed most of my attention for the last two years. Therefore I have made the tough decision to retire from the project and hand over the reigns to someone fresh and motivated.</p>
<p>A ballot was conducted among the team members to decide my successor. Nominations were open to all team members and Stefan was the successful candidate. I am very confident that the project will be in safe hands under Stefan's leadership given the excellent job he has done steering development efforts over the past year.</p>
<p>I am also very excited to see what the future holds for MyBB. I hope my retirement will allow some of the newer team members to take greater ownership over the project and help take MyBB to new heights. In particular I'm pleased by the work towards 2.0 which has begun recently and I hope the team will be able to share more about that with you soon.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank the community for their support of the project, and the team who I have greatly enjoyed collaborating with over the years.</p>
<p>Regards, Tim B.</p>
