<p>The MyBB Merge System for 1.8 is <a href="http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/merge_1.8.00.zip">now available</a> from the MyBB website.</p>
<h1>What's new in this version?</h1>
<p>First we decided to drop some old modules which aren't supported by their developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBPress 1</li>
<li>IP.Board 2</li>
<li>Mingle</li>
<li>phpBB 2</li>
<li>vBulletin 3</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course we've added more new modules (including some which you requested fairly often in the past)</p>
<ul>
<li>BBPress 2</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board Lite 2</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board 3</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board 4</li>
<li>IP.Board 3</li>
<li>IP.Board 4 (Based on the latest Preview Release)</li>
<li>vBulletin 4</li>
<li>FluxBB</li>
<li>XenForo</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, we fixed finally a lot of known issues with the merge system: <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.8.0">Fixed Bugs</a><br />
But (as always) there're still some <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue">Known Bugs</a>.</p>
<h1>Translations and the Merge System</h1>
<p>Till now the Merge System was only available in english, however we decided to make the Merge System translatable too. The language file is located at "merge/language/".</p>
<h1>Help us!</h1>
<p>You can report bugs and help us with the development at <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/">GitHub</a> but even if you can't code you can help us with sending us some sample databases (more infos on the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-158645.html">forums</a>).</p>
