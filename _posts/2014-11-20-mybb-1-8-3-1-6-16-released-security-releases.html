<h2>MyBB 1.8.3</h2>
<p>MyBB 1.8.3 is now available from the MyBB website. It fixes 1 high risk vulnerability, 2 medium risk vulnerabilities and 3 low risk vulnerabilities. We recommend everyone upgrades to this release immediately.</p>
<h4>What's added/changed in this version?</h4>
<p>The vulnerabilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Risk: A SQL injection vulnerability in theme selection (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-2824.html" target="_blank">StefanT</a>)</li>
<li>Medium Risk: A XSS vulnerability in calender.php (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-90703.html" target="_blank">-Acid</a>)</li>
<li>Medium Risk: A XSS vulnerability in MyCode editor (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-69212.html" target="_blank">My-BB.Ir</a>)</li>
<li>Low Risk: A XSS vulnerability related to post icons (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-58253.html" target="_blank">Destroy666</a>)</li>
<li>Low Risk: unserialize may call PHP magic methods (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-90701.html" target="_blank">chtg</a>)</li>
<li>Low Risk: PHP setting request_order can break register globals handling (reported by <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-90701.html" target="_blank">chtg</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally we've fixed an issue with the video MyCode introduced with MyBB 1.8.2 (<a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/1625" target="_blank">#1625</a>) and revised the handling of data fetched from our website as a direct consequence of the <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2014/11/15/github-account-compromised/" target="_blank">compromised GitHub account</a> (<a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/1617" target="_blank">#1617</a>). In addition to that, we've set the adminsid cookie as httpOnly (<a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues/1622" target="_blank">#1622</a>). We also plan to add enhanced options to protect the Admin CP like two factor authentication with one of the next maintenance releases.</p>
