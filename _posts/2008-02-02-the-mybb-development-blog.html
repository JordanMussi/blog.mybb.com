<p>Welcome to the MyBB Development Blog, the place where from now on we'll primarily be talking about what is going on behind the scenes at the MyBB Group as well as taking a look at upcoming features in new releases.</p>
<p>We hope to keep the blog fairly active and we've got quite a few posts planned already:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extensive MyBB 1.4 Control Panel Overview</strong><br />
A series of posts which will contain a full overview of the MyBB 1.4 Admin CP including many screenshots, feature overviews and our design and technical decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Plugin Development Tips &amp; Tricks<br />
</strong>A few tips and tricks for getting the most out of the MyBB Plugin System.</li>
<li><strong>Regular MyBB Tips and Tricks<br />
</strong>Ranging from security related tips and tricks right through to uncovering some of the more hidden features and customising your copy of MyBB.</li>
<li><strong>Behind the Scenes<br />
</strong>A look at how things happen behind the scenes with MyBB, including our development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you're looking forward to being able to discuss some of the things above with us on this blog, as we're very much interested in your feedback for a lot of the above to help improve MyBB in the future. Stay tuned for another post shortly.</p>
