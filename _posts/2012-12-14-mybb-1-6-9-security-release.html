<h4>What's added/changed in this version?</h4>

<p>With thanks to frostschutz and StefanT for finding and reporting these issues.</p>

</ul>

<p>We apologise for any inconvenience.</p>
<h4>Upgrading from 1.6.8 and Other Versions</h4>
<p>Before performing any upgrade please remember to backup your forum's files and database and store them safely. If you have edited core files, including language files, please make sure you make a changelog for these changes so you can make them again once the upgrade is complete.</p>
<p>To upgrade, follow the Upgrading process. The <strong>upgrade script</strong> is required. There are changes to <strong>1 language file</strong> (<em>messages.lang.php</em>). There are changes to <strong>3 templates</strong> (<em>portal_welcome_guesttext</em>, <em>loginbox</em> &amp; <em>codebuttons</em>).</p>
