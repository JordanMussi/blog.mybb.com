<p>Hello MyBB fans!<br />
So it's been a while since the last "Staff changes" blog post! We've had quite a few changes recently and thought it would be a perfect time to give you all an update on our great team.</p>
<h4>Welcome our new staff members</h4>
<p>Please welcome <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-16693.html">FÃ¡bio Maia</a> to the support team, more commonly known as faviouz to us all. faviouz has been a very helpful member on the community forums and has released several plugins and tutorials.<br />
Also welcome <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8582.html">Pirata Nervo</a> to the development team! Pirata has been an extremely helpful member and has also developed many great plugins.</p>
<h4>Thank staff who have moved on</h4>
<p>Our long-time contributor <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-14.html">Alan Crisp</a> has left after many years on the team. A while ago he took a job as a PHP developer with skills that he learned while on the team. This very job is what has led to him resigning from the team, with little free time to continue contributing. He thanks us for all the opportunities he was given here, and we thank him for his efforts, sincerely.<br />
We're also sad to see <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-24127.html">Conor Calby</a> leave, after a very helpful year on the team he has left due to time constraints as well. We hope he finds the time in the future to return.<br />
Unfortunately one of our more recent additions to the team, <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-34795.html">thebod</a>, also had to leave due to other commitments.</p>
<p>We are very thankful to anyone offering their time to MyBB and we wish those who left the very best of luck.</p>
<h4>Applications are always open</h4>
<p>If you would like to be a part of one of the teams we have here at MyBB (development, support, SQA), please take a look at <a href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply">this page</a> for more information.</p>
