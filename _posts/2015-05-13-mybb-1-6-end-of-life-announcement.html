<p>MyBB 1.8 was released almost 9 months ago (September 1st, 2014 for those keeping track) and has since proven to be stable. Therefore we will be concluding maintenance and support for the MyBB 1.6 series, and we encourage everyone who has not already done so to upgrade to MyBB 1.8 as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>The end of life date for MyBB 1.6 will be the 1st of September, 2015.</strong></p>
<p>After this date:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not be offering official support for MyBB 1.6.</li>
<li>There will be no further maintenance or security releases for the 1.6 series.</li>
<li>The 1.6 support forums will be closed and archived.</li>
</ul>
