<p>The MyBB Group has had an IRC channel for several years hosted on irc.msgplus.net but it hasn't been widely publicized for a long time and is only regularly used by a small number of people.  Today we're announcing something of a relaunch for the official MyBB IRC channel and with it our move to the <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a> network.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the move has to do with the fact that MyBB is now an open-source project.  Freenode is a huge hub of open-source software groups and many well know projects maintain a presence there.  By moving our channel onto the Freenode network we hope to add a new arm to our existing community whilst expanding our reach further into the wider open-source community.  Also, since Freenode is quite a popular IRC network it's possible the IRC users amongst you may already have an account registered there.</p>
<p>MyBB staff will be around some of the time but this is <em><u>not</u></em> an official support resource.  Official support will remain to be solely available on the <a href="http://community.mybb.com">MyBB Community Forums</a>.  The IRC channel is intended as more of an informal place for users to come along and engage with other members of the community, although common sense rules will apply.</p>
<p>If you feel like coming along and joining us, you can do so by connecting your IRC client of choice to <strong>irc.freenode.net</strong> and joining <strong>#mybb</strong>.  Alternatively a web-chat interface is available at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">http://webchat.freenode.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Happy chatting.</p>
