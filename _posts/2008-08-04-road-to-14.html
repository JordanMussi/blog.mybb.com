<p>Well... it's been a long journey folks; With <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/thread-34565.html">MyBB 1.4 released</a>, we thought it might be a good idea to tell you how 1.4 got to where it is today. So without further ado, we present to you the Road to MyBB 1.4.</p>
<h4>April 2006:</h4>
<p>The first pre-alpha mockups of the ACP are shown internally to the staff. Ideas are collected for 1.4 and discussed and our general feature list is planned.</p>
<h4>September 2006:</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4â€™s development pace starts picking up once MyBB 1.2 Final is released.</p>
<h4>October 2006:</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4's new ACP is being planned and drafted.</p>
<h4>February 2nd, 2007:</h4>
<p>After 8 rewrites, MyBB 1.4's ACP's core is finally written. The first page, the settings page, is started.</p>
<h4>March 2007:</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4's new ACP base/core continues to be improved. Some beginning pages (Dashboard/Credits) are done and others are in progress. A chunk of front-end features are in the works or completed.</p>
<h4>October 21st, 2007:</h4>
<p>A good portion of the MyBB 1.4 ACP is done. 99% of MyBB's front-end features are done. This day MyBB 1.4 is open to a select few for beta testing.</p>
<h4>March 19th, 2008:</h4>
<p>The first download of MyBB is available to testers. All of the ACP is completed except the Themes page. 100+ bugs were reported and fixed within this timeframe. More testers are invited.</p>
<h4>May 2nd, 2008:</h4>
<p>The second refresh of MyBB is available to testers. All of the ACP is completed. 100+ bugs were reported and fixed in this timeframe. All of the translators, and many mod creators and theme creators were invited at this time.</p>
<h4>June 23rd, 2008:</h4>
<p>The sixth refresh of MyBB is available to testers. Bug reports have slowed. Since refresh two over 300+ bugs were fixed.</p>
<h4>June 26th, 2008:</h4>
<p>A publicly joinable private beta of MyBB is open to users.</p>
<h4>July 6th, 2008:</h4>
<p>The second beta of MyBB 1.4 is posted, including 40+ bug fixes from Beta 1.</p>
<h4>August 3rd, 2008:</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.4 is released.</p>
<p>All in all, in the development timeframe of 1.4 over a quarter of a million lines of code have changes in over 1,700 commits, over 500 bugs were fixed and many additional suggestions were implemented during our 6+ month beta process.</p>
<p>Also, throughout this process the MyBB Merge System was being worked on and the MyBB 1.2 series was being maintained.</p>
<p>We hope everyone enjoys the new functionality and changes we've provided in MyBB 1.4 :)</p>
