<p>Today marks the <em>2 year anniversary</em> since MyBB 1.4 was released. It is an honor to announce that today, we are releasing <strong>MyBB 1.6 Gold</strong> to the general public and that it is now available directly on the <a href="http://mybb.com/">MyBB website</a>.</p>
<p>MyBB 1.6 may be one small step for forum software, but it is one giant leap for MyBB. There are <a href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=1" target="_blank"><strong>over 40 </strong>new features</a> that have been built in to MyBB and countless tweaks, fixes, and performance optimizations since MyBB 1.4.</p>
<p>We've also updated the MyBB website to contain a feature tour of what is available in MyBB 1.6: <a href="http://www.mybb.com/features">http://www.mybb.com/features</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend that all users upgrade to 1.6 so they can take advantage of the great new features in MyBB 1.6, but we recommend you plan your upgrade first. More information on upgrading and changes to templates, themes, plugins and languages can be found below.</p>
<p>Personally I'd also like to thank this community, for your everlasting support and for all of you who have been with us every step of the way. You've made this happen; MyBB is your forum software. Above all, I would like to thank every single team member who has made this journey with us. My debt to you is beyond measure. Thank you so much for the time, sweat, and effort you've given to this project and community. We are all grateful to you.</p>

<h3>Upgrading from previous versions</h3>
<p>You can update your copy of MyBB to 1.6 if you're running MyBB 1.0 RC2 or onwards (which you should already be).</p>
<p><strong>Be warned that with the following release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Custom templates will need to be updated for this release via the "Find Updated Templates" tool in the MyBB 1.6 Administration Control Panel.</li>
<li>Most plugins and code modifications will need to be updated to work with MyBB 1.6. Make sure you disable your plugins before upgrading and make sure updated copies compatible with MyBB 1.6 are available.</li>
<li>Custom language packs from earlier versions will need to be updated as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Before you attempt to upgrade, ensure you have a database backup and a copy of the files currently in use on your board.</strong> This is so you can revert back to your earlier version if you need to or something goes horribly wrong with the upgrade process.</p>
<p>This is a moderately long upgrade process. Please make sure you don't refresh pages whilst they're loading, and don't click the "Next" button more than once (if you don't have JavaScript enabled). <strong>You should plan your upgrade before attempting to perform it.</strong></p>
<p>Follow the general <a href="http://wiki.mybb.com/index.php/Upgrading">[Wiki: Upgrading]</a> guide outlined on the MyBB Wiki to complete the upgrade process.</p>
<h4>License</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.6 is now distributed under the GNU LGPLv3 license. The only major difference between this license and the GNU GPLv3 license that MyBB has been licensed under since MyBB 1.4.2, is the ability for plugin and theme authors to have more freedom in the license they choose to distribute their work under.</p>
<p>To the average user, this change does not affect the way you use MyBB or run your forums. You do not need to change anything, you just need to make sure you comply with the terms and conditions set out via the GNU LGPL - which if you meet our current license agreement, you already do.</p>
<h4>Theme and template changes</h4>
<p>Several updates have been added to the theme which give you more control over the stylesheet and appearance of your forum and the new features. For this reason, your theme is updated to work with MyBB 1.6 during the upgrade process.</p>
<p>The same applies with templates; you'll need to use the "Find Updated Templates" on any custom templates to update them due to the fact that many of them have been updated.</p>
<h4>Language packs</h4>
<p>Language packs also need to be updated as there are many changes in the language files. This includes addition of language strings and improving or updating of some current language strings.</p>
<p>Before you attempt to use any language pack with MyBB 1.6 you'll need to ensure it has been updated accordingly to the changes made in the release.</p>
<h4>Plugins</h4>
<p>Most plugins can be updated with minimal changes. In most cases the version compatibility indicator can be updated safely within the plugin and it will work with MyBB 1.6 without further change. However, some plugins may require more extensive changes.</p>
<p>If you require assistance making your modification or theme compatible with MyBB 1.6 then please post in the appropriate code modifications or Template &amp; Theme forum on <a href="http://community.mybb.com/">http://community.mybb.com/</a></p>
<p>As of the release of 1.6, there are several plugins and themes immediately available for download from the MyBB Mods site and many more to come soon.</p>
<h4>MyBB Merge System</h4>
<p>As of this MyBB 1.6 release, a version of the MyBB Merge System compatible with MyBB 1.6 has been released on the <a href="http://www.mybb.com/downloads/merge-system">MyBB website</a> to the general public.</p>
