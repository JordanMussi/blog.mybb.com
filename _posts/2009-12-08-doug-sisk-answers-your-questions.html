<p>Sorry for the long delay, I've been busy with end of year school work. <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-13144.html">Doug</a> was eager to answer his questions, getting back to me less than a day after I sent his questions to him.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm Doug Sisk and I live in the barren lands of South Dakota in the US. I started working with MyBB back in 2007 when I started doing web design. MyBB is what inspired me to learn PHP &amp; MySQL, and by the end of 2008, I was on the MyBB Team. Besides MyBB, I'm the technical administrator for the Roller Coaster Simulator website <a href="http://rctlounge.com/">RCTLounge</a>, I own an Amusement Park Blog, <a href="http://parkthoughts.com/">Park Thoughts</a>, and I do some projects through my personal company, amply named <a href="http://www.dougsisk.com/">Doug Sisk Design</a>. I'm a Junior in High School, and I'm very active in band, participating in Marching, Concert, and Jazz band. I play synthesizer in Marching, piano in Jazz, and percussion in Concert. I also enjoy dreaming about Roller Coasters, watching TV, and hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>I was on the SQA team from November 2008-2009, and I am now a developer. I will be assisting in bug fixing the upcoming 1.6 series, and I will be also developing features for the future 2.0 series.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite gadget and why?</h4>
<p>I don't think I have a "favorite" gadget. I love my Computer, iPod Touch, and cell phone equally. The computer is where my work is, my iPod Touch has all the music and podcasts I enjoy, and my cell phone lets me keep in touch with friends. Between the iPod and cell phone though, I would choose the iPod as my favorite. It's great being able to keep up with the stuff I follow online right from it. I watch a ton of <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3</a> shows, mainly Diggnation, Tekzilla, and Film Riot. I occasionally watch Scam School from time to time.</p>
<h4>Describe to us what it means to you to be on the MyBB team.</h4>
<p>For me, being on the MyBB Team is a honor. This software is the best out there. There are very few free software programs out there that have the dedication and support like MyBB. It always amazes me how dedicated everyone is to the project for not being paid. For me, the payment is knowing that thousands of people have a way to communicate for free. It's still hard for me to believe that I'm part of such a huge project.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>I really don't know what my favorite feature in MyBB is. I'm sure I'll have one come 2.0 series!</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>When I was younger, my dream career was to go into the Amusement Park Industry. However, as I've grown older, I've realized that it isn't what I want to do everyday of my work life. I have done so well at web design and development, that it has already turned into a job rather than a hobby for me. I don't think there are many people that can say they make money from their hobby!</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Other than MyBB, I spend time checking up on the websites I work with, and the rest of the websites I follow. I mainly check out Facebook, Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/DougSD">DougSD</a>), and Digg. I also make my rounds looking at Web Design galleries and blogs to see what the trends are. When I'm not on computer, I'm usually listening to music (my favorite bands are Jack's Mannequin and Something Corporate), playing piano, drumming, drawing random sketches of websites and things, or watching TV (my favorite shows are Mythbusters, The Office, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon).</p>
<h4>Where do you see yourself in 10 years time?</h4>
<p>I have no clue where I'll be in 10 years. Hopefully, I'll be at a successful web design or marketing agency.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite programming language?</h4>
<p>PHP, as it's the only language I know fluently. I have a brief knowledge of jQuery and Javascript, but it's far from great. I've attempted to learn Ruby, but I gave up. Not my cup of tea.</p>
<h4>Who inspires you?</h4>
<p>The web design firm that has inspired me since I started in 2007 is <a href="http://electricpulp.com/">Electric Pulp</a>, South Dakota's best web design firm. They always have outstanding designs. I get all my inspiration from viewing galleries. My favorite gallery I check weekly is <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com/">Best Web Gallery</a>. It really is nice to see the wide ranges of design types being used.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>I don't really think I have much else to say. I think I got everything about me down. I'm not always one for giving out information online, but I don't mind giving out a little about me.</p>
