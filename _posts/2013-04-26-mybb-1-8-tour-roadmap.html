<p>MyBB 1.8 is the next minor release for the 1.x series. The aim of this release is to introduce a level of standardisation and organisation that MyBB has previously lacked and to bring the series into line with other products and services that we hope to bring to you in the near future.</p>
<p>1.8 is a huge leap forward for the 1.x series. It will introduce some powerful new features while also providing a stable forum solution for your community for years to come. It will also allow us, the MyBB Group, to focus on the next generation of our software - the anticipated 2.x series.</p>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Due to the extended development and testing phase of 1.6.10, as well as the usual lull in activity due to workload, exams and holidays, MyBB 1.8 isn’t as far along its roadmap as we would like. Naturally we are disappointed but we remain committed to creating and providing one of the most advanced free forum software packages available.</p>
<p>Further to this we are, as a group, undergoing huge changes to how we work to help make releases quicker. These past 12 months has seen an insane amount of work completed by our team, much of which is behind-the-scenes, and we hope to bring news of this to you very soon.</p>
<p>With updates in mind, you can now find the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-138326.html" target="_blank"><strong>MyBB 1.8 Roadmap on our community forums</strong></a>. This thread will be kept up to date with the latest news, features and bug fixes that are happening during its development.</p>
<h4>Release Date</h4>
<p>As always, MyBB 1.8 will be released when we feel it is ready. We opened our GitHub project to the public so that anyone - not just the MyBB Team - can help with development of the 1.x series. Even if you can’t code, anyone can download both branches (1.6 &amp; 1.8) to help test bugs and offer suggestions for improvements. Alongside our roadmap you can keep up to date with the project and see what is coming next.</p>
<p>1.8 is not feature locked at this moment in time. However, we don’t plan on introducing further major overhauls to help avoid plugin and theme incompatibilities. </p>
<h4>Joining the Team</h4>
<p>There has never been a more exciting time in MyBB’s history; with 1.6 ready for new technologies, 1.8 on the way and starting 2.x soon (which is looking absolutely awesome) 2013 is already proving to be a busy year. If you feel you have got what it takes to be a dedicated volunteer for the project we’d love to have you on the team!</p>
<p>We’re currently looking for developers for the 1.x series, SQA team members and members for our new Resources Team - who will be focused on managing our community services. If you are interested in any of these PM a staff member, post an application in our <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">Private Inquiries forum</a> or <a href="http://www.mybb.com/contact">send us an email</a>.</p>
