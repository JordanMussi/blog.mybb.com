We're looking for people with a strong background in web development with PHP and MySQL as well as a solid understanding of how MyBB operates in both code and functionality to become an active particpiant in our development team, preferably having released MyBB plugins or modifications at some stage. Knowledge of other database management systems such as PostgreSQL and SQLite is also highly favourable. You must be able to work well with a team and work under project management.</p>
<p>Your primary position will be working with myself and the other developers to bring new releases of MyBB out.</li>
<li><strong>Support Team Positions</strong><br />
We're looking for people who are dedicated to MyBB and have a solid understanding of the functionality of MyBB and have experience in managing a forum themself, an understanding of PHP and MySQL is not required however may be beneficial. You must be able to work well with other team members. You must be able to communicate clearly and correct in English.</p>
<p>All we ask of you is that you're an active participant in both supporting other users with MyBB and can do so in a professional manner.</li>
