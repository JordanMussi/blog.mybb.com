<p>One of our newest additions to the team, <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-23291.html">Huji Lee</a> answered the next batch of questions. PS. Please welcome Huji. :)</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm 27 (which probably makes the grandfather of the whole MyBB team), and I live in the United States. I'm a self-taught web developer with focus on Web 2.0 solutions developed using PHP and MySQL.</p>
<h4>Besides MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Who said MyBB is a hobby?! Anyways, I used to play different musical instruments and listen to music a lot.</p>
<h4>Who inspires you?</h4>
<p>I'm not much an "inspiration" guy. In other words, everybody is an inspiration to me.</p>
<h4>How long does it take you to fix the average bug with MyBB?</h4>
<p>A few minutes.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite type of music?</h4>
<p>I listen to many kinds of music and I always want to keep myself open to new genres. You can find me listening to Bach, Metallica, Naruto (Japanese), Don Omar (Puerto Rican Reggaet√≥n) and Lionel Richie in the same day!</p>
<h4>Name an item that you one day wish to own.</h4>
<p>If you asked this 15 years ago, my answer would definitely be a model helicopter! Right now, I'm thinking of an iPhone instead! ;)</p>
<h4>If you didn't discover MyBB, what do you think you'd be doing with your free time instead?</h4>
<p>Coding for one of the other projects I dedicated my time to.</p>
<h4>What program do you use to code in?</h4>
<p>Notepad++ as my editor, an old version of Aqua Data Studio for some DB manipulations.</p>
<h4>Which type of weather do you prefer?</h4>
<p>I like it when the weather is cool.</p>
<h4>How does it feel knowing that software you've played a part in is being used by people all around the world?</h4>
<p>It brings excitement and responsibility.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>Some people ask me how is it that you only had less than 50 posts in the Community forums and you end up in the Developers team. I benefited from a MyBB based forum about a real issue in my life so I felt I owe MyBB team for making that possible; I talked to the lead developer Ryan Gordon and he figured I might be of assistance. If anybody who reads this also feels like he owes MyBB a favor, I think they should step forward too.</p>
