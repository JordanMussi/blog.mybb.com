<p>As part of our recent (and emergency) server migration, we've just finished restructuring our development server (that hosts the <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/">MyBB Development Portal</a> and Subversion repositories). As a result, if you're checking out and working with our Subversion repositories, please be aware that the URLs for doing so have changed.</p>
<p>The new official Subversion repositories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyBB - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Merge System - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Modifications - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've already checked out a copy of MyBB using Subversion, you can switch your local copy to the new URL using the following command:<br />
<code>svn switch --relocate http://dev.mybboard.net/svn/mybb/ http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb</code></p>
<p><strong>Please note that the old Subversion URLs will continue to work for the majority of users the time being.</strong> However, if you're running Mac OS X, you'll need to switch to the new URLs due to a bug with the Subversion client that ships with Mac OS X.</p>
