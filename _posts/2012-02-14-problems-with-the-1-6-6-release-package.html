<p>A few days ago we <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2012/02/10/mybb-1-6-6-security-release/">released version 1.6.6</a>, unfortunately we have since realized that the version released was a newer SVN revision than intended, and as a result contains some development code that may compromise the stability of your board.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this is not a security issue, and we are not aware of any security implications arising from the release.</strong></p>
<p>The issue was rectified shortly after the release and<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> only the main release was affected, not the changed files package.</span></p>
<p>We advise anyone who used the full release package within the first 24 hours of its release to run the file verification tool in their admin control panel (Tools &amp; Maintenance &gt; File Verification). If any files show differences which are not manual file modifications they should be replaced with files from the current version of the release package.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
MyBB Team</p>
