<p>For the past seven years, MyBB has had an ever-growing and changing community, and through it all the "MyBB Group" itself is still a small set of dedicated individuals. Up until now MyBB has been developed in a relatively private fashion.  Recently, it seems as the tides have turned; we have realized that you want more: you want the cutting edge, you want to be more a part of the "Real MyBB", and you want the best free forum software that free can buy. We've listened to your advice, and we are now pleased to announce the availability of public access to our development site, including access to the latest and greatest cutting edge MyBB!</p>
<h4>What does this mean for you?</h4>
<p>With the community more closely involved with MyBB's development, we will be able to ensure releases are more stable and you will be able to get access to the latest bug fixes and features. We hope that by making our development site available and open to the public that more people will take an interest in MyBB and get involved!</p>
<h4>How exactly do you get access?</h4>
<p>The link to the development site is <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/">http://dev.mybboard.net/</a>. This will give you direct access to our MyBB 1.4 repository, MyBB 1.6 repository including all the latest features and fixes. This will also be where you report bugs with MyBB and its related projects. We have generated detailed information on our Wiki's revamped Development section: <a href="http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Development">http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Development</a>. The Development section will be the best place to ask your questions and concerns regarding the site, SVN access, coding standards, and other procedures.</p>
<p>Please note that the MyBB group officially supports only the latest release series, as of writing, MyBB 1.4.x.  Although you have access to the latest MyBB 1.6.x code, there may be partially-committed features which are broken.  We do not recommend using the development "trunk" on production forums, and they will <strong>NOT </strong>be supported by the support staff here.</p>
