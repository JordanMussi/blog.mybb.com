<p>MyBB Merge System 1.6.3 is <a href="http://www.mybb.com/downloads/merge-system">now available</a> on the MyBB website and is a maintenance update to the MyBB Merge 1.6 series.</p>
<p>This release is to ensure that all users of MyBB Merge 1.6 have the latest fixes.</p>
<p>This release fixes several reported issues since the release of  1.6.2, which caused some incorrect functionality of the Merge System.  These bugs have been fixed to provide a more stable version of the Merge System for  public use.</p>
<h4><strong>What's fixed in this version?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>7 bug fixes (<a href="http://dev.mybb.com/projects/mybb-import/versions/40">view all</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This includes some critical fixes for things that will cause the system to catastrophically fail.<br />
NOTE: After this release the merge system will jump to match MyBB's version. So when MyBB 1.6.7 is released, MyBB Merge System 1.6.7 will be released with it. We're going to try very hard to use that scheme from now on.</p>
