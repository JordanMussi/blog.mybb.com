<p>MyBB 1.6.11 is now available from the MyBB website and is a security and maintenance release.</p>
<h4>Important Security Patches</h4>
<p>It was reported to us by Philly that a user was able to register on his forum with three 'emoji' characters which led to the user becoming "unregistered". After looking in to this issue we discovered it was more complex than originally thought.</p>
<p>The technical explanation is MySQL's UTF8 implementation only supports up to 3 bytes per character. When someone tries to insert a string containing a 4 byte utf8 character in to the database, MySQL truncates the string immediately before the 4 byte character. Not only does this affect security, it affects the user's experience as half their post or private message could be lost without them knowing why.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was exploited by a user registering on a forum with a username consisting of only 4 byte UTF8 characters. As I explained before, MySQL truncates the string before the first occurrence of a 4 byte UTF8 character which led to the username column becoming empty. When someone sent a PM it would be automatically sent to the nameless user and they would be able to read it.</p>
<p>This security issue affects <strong>MySQL</strong> databases with a <strong>utf8_general_ci</strong> collation (This may also affect utf8_unicode_ci collations too). If you're using a SQLite or PostgreSQL database you're not affected by this.</p>
