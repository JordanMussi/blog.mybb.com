        <p>Not long ago, we started a new project to gather information about the PHP versions that various web hosts support. The aim of this project was to gather a list of web hosting companies who would be able to host the upcoming MyBB 2.0 release.</p>
<p>Since starting that project, we have received several contributions. However, we've also since <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-195675.html" target="_blank">changed the PHP version requirements</a> that we will require for 2.0. As such, we are closing the mybb/2.0-Hosts repository and instead asking that users please make use of <a href="http://phpversions.info/">the PHP Versions website</a> to track the PHP versions on offer at different hosts. This website operates in a similar way to the old MyBB project, but is much more widely used and already contains information for lots of different hosts. For more information on contribution to the PHP Versions website, please see <a href="https://github.com/philsturgeon/phpversions.info/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">the contributing guide</a>.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Yep, you read that right. The MyBB 2.0 repositories are finally open to the public for browsing and contribution. The repositories we are opening are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb2">mybb/mybb2</a> - the core of MyBB 2.0, based on a Laravel skeleton template. This repository contains the core forum and is where the majority of work happens. The overall structure of this repository will be changing through the New Year to make deployment easier on shared hosts and other setups.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mybb/Auth">mybb/Auth</a> - a modified authentication package for MyBB 2.0. This is based around the Laravel 5.0 Auth package, and is about to receive a major overhaul to make use of the Laravel 5.1 and 5.2 authentication changes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mybb/Parser">mybb/Parser</a> - the core post parser for MyBB 2.0. The majority of the parsing logic has simply been imported from MyBB 1.x in the current incarnation in order to get a working parser implementation. The future plans for this repository include adding further unit tests and refactoring the BBCode/MyCode parsing to use a proper parser/lexer rather than a large jumble of regular expressions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mybb/settings">mybb/Settings</a> - the core settings system of MyBB 2.0. This package provides both site-wide and user settings and can easily be used for other projects and plugins. Settings are split into "packages", with "mybb/core" being the core MyBB package. Further documentation and details will be explained about this package in an upcoming development post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsing these repositories should make it fairly clear that while MyBB 2.0 has had a good start so far, it is still far from done. Original plans were to have an Alpha release available by the end of 2015, but these plans have unfortunately not come to fruition. It is our hope that making these repositories public will bring more contributions, suggestions and feedback from you the community.</p>
<p>For now we are simply opening these repositories, but over the New Year and Christmas holidays we will be documenting our code formatting, contribution guidelines and our roadmap and plans for MyBB 2.0 more fully in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-194.html">MyBB 2.0 Planned Features</a> forum. Rather than blogging about each of these, we will be writing topics that will be stuck to that forum to provide guidelines about our expectations.</p>
<p>We also plan to keep up our (recently lacking) development blog posts which will cover the usage of the components we are open sourcing as well as other components that will be created in the future. Future components and progress will be developed fully in the open, utilising <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2015/05/09/change-of-license-for-mybb-2-0/">our new BSD-3 licence</a>.</p>
<p>As a closing note, MyBB 2 is in no way stable yet and should <strong>not</strong> be used on a live forum at all right now. Open sourcing these repositories is aimed primarily at developers and experienced administrators wanting to provide input and feedback on the future direction of MyBB. No support will be provided for any of the code in these repositories until we reach a Beta release.</p>
<p>We wish all of our users a happy holiday season,</p>
<p>The MyBB team</p>

        <p>It’s that time again, time for another MyBB 2.0 dev blog! This post is the fifth in a series of development update posts regarding MyBB 2.0. Currently in pre-alpha, MyBB 2.0 is the long awaited upcoming major version of the open source MyBB forum software. We’ll be posting regular updates (we promise!) in regards to the development to keep you all updated. The development team have been hard at work since <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2015/07/01/2-0-dev-post-4/">our last dev post</a>, adding new features and polishing existing functionality. This post will explore some of these new features and highlight our approach to the development of the system.</p>
<p>Note that all screenshots and details contained within these posts are subject to change and is taken from early developmental software; details are in no way indicative of the features or presentation of the final software.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Request for feedback regarding the attachment system in 2.0</h2>
<p>This month we created a topic asking for feedback regarding the new attachment system in 2.0, which can be <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-174591.html">found here</a>.</p>
<p>This thread is the first of hopefully many as we try to promote community input into the future of MyBB. We’ve been trying to be more open for a while now and this is the next step in that evolution. All feedback is encouraged and gratefully received, though we do ask that users check if their suggestion has already been posted rather than repeating suggestions. If somebody has already posted a suggestion and you wish to just note your agreement, please simply quote the original suggestion and state your agreement.</p>
<p>We will be using this system to announce any new features we’re working on or at least considering before we start implementation, allowing us to run our ideas past the community. Before creating a thread, the staff will have already agreed on a basic set of features that we both want and definitely do not want (for example, with the attachment system, we have agreed as a staff team that we definitely do <strong>not</strong> want a gallery system).</p>
<h2>Enhancing organisation of the 2.0 forum</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing restructuring and reorganisation, we’re going to start writing new threads within the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-193.html">MyBB 2.0 Implemented Features</a> forum. This will be an ongoing effort which I should be making a start to this week. This will make it easier for users to comment upon and provide feedback to features we’ve already announced and/or shown within these development posts.</p>
<h2>How we code 2.0: Code style</h2>
<p>As we have been doing in recent posts, I’d like to take a chance to look at the coding standards that we’re following to write MyBB 2.0.</p>
<p>For 2.0, we’re following the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR–4 autoloader specification</a> for how we structure the physical lay out of our classes within files. Basically, it boils down to the following (class is shown on the left, the resolved path is shown to the right):</p>
<pre><code>MyBB\Core\Database\Models\User — ./app/Database/Models/User.php
MyBB\Core\Http\Controllers\UserController — ./app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this specification leads to a very clear layout and organisation of code rather than the MyBB 1.x approach of just putting every file inside <code>./inc/</code>.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual code format, we’re basically following <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">the PSR–2 standard</a>, though we are using tabs rather than spaces. We know that the issue of tabs vs. spaces is rather divisive, so we’d rather not get into any arguments here but our basic reasoning is that we’d rather not waste 4 characters where one character suffices. Additionally, most modern code editors can handle either tabs or spaces as pretty much the same.</p>
<p>In order to aid in the following of these standards, Jones has <a href="https://github.com/mybb/standards">created a set of rules</a> that can be used with <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP CodeSniffer</a>. These rules are ran automatically by Circle CI (see Dev Post #4 for more information on how we use Circle CI to provide continuous integration!) to make sure that all code committed to our Git repositories follows the same standards. This leads to the MyBB 2.0 codebase having a very clear and readable codebase that’s cohesive throughout.</p>
<p>Obviously, we <em>will not</em> force these code standards on plugin authors and such, but everybody contributing to the core will be expected to follow them (and will in fact be forced to by CircleCI).</p>
<h2>New feature: collapsing single posts</h2>
<p>MyBB 2.0 has now picked up the ability to be able to collapse posts out of view. In the future, we will be adding the option to automatically collapse posts created by certain users (as an enhancement upon the current user ignore system found in MyBB 1.x). This allows users to automatically hide content from other users that they find distracting but optionally expand them if they wish to.</p>
<p>Each post can be collapsed and expanded using a simple toggle switch found at the top right of every post. Users who use Reddit may find this feature rather familiar.</p>

<h2>Moderation System</h2>
<p>The moderation system is receiving a major overhaul for MyBB 2.0 thanks to a lot of work done by Will. The new system allows plugin developers and integrators to easily add both new and existing moderation tools to their new content types and to add entirely new moderation tools by simply writing a class or implementing a PHP Trait. This makes the moderation system far more flexible than it previously has been.</p>
<p>A few screenshots of this new moderation system are below, showcasing multiple post selection, the new inline modification toolbar that follows your navigation throughout the page and the moving of a topic to another forum.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2551" align="aligncenter" width="660"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/2-0-multi-post-selection.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2551" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/2-0-multi-post-selection.png" alt="Selecting and managing multiple posts within a topic.

Basic moderation tools such as this one can be utilised without loading another page via the use of modals, greatly improving the experience and efficiency of the moderator tools for staff.[/caption]</p>
<h2>Avatar enhancements</h2>
<p>In MyBB 2.0, it is now possible to automatically crop and position your avatar after uploading it rather than having to edit your images in some specialised desktop software. This is an extremely useful feature that can lead to much nicer looking avatars for everyone.</p>
<p>Additionally, avatars can be uploaded by simply dragging and dropping an image onto any place on the screen that your avatar is shown. Doing so will automatically upload the image and present the crop screen to the user.</p>
<h2>Minimum PHP version announcement</h2>
<p>Since the release of <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/releases#laravel-5.1">Laravel 5.1</a>, which is a long term support (LTS) release, the minimum PHP version required for MyBB 2.0 has been updated to <strong>PHP 5.5.9</strong>, which is required as it fixes several bugs found in previous PHP releases. Laravel 5.1 is guaranteed bug fixes for 2 years and security issues for 3 years, allowing peace of mind and stability for the project.</p>
<p>As part of this change, we’ve started to compile a list of hosts which support PHP 5.5.9 or later out of the box. Given the forthcoming End Of Life of PHP 5.4 (September 14) major providers are expected to begin the natural process of making higher versions (PHP 5.5 or 5.6) available or preset by default, which is why we'd love to receive community input on keeping it up to date. In order to facilitate this effort, we’ve created <a href="https://github.com/mybb/2.0-Hosts">a new repository on our GitHub</a> account that we are asking the community to contribute to so that we have a list of hosts that we know will support MyBB 2.0 ready for release.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<p>These development posts haven’t exactly been following a strict schedule recently and I can only apologise for this. We’re going to be trying to commit to a more regular update schedule going forward.</p>

        <p>It’s that time again, time for another MyBB 2.0 dev blog! This post is the fourth in a series of development update posts regarding MyBB 2.0.  Currently in pre-alpha, MyBB 2.0 is the long awaited upcoming major version of the open source MyBB forum software.  We’ll be posting regular updates (we promise!) in regards to the development to keep you all updated.

<p>This month has been slightly slower than most due to many of our team members being busy finishing up university courses, exams and more. However, we've still managed to work away on new features and plan out new features. In this post, we will review some of the exciting new features and some of the plans we have for the future of 2.0.<!--more--></p>
<h2>CircleCI to ensure working builds</h2>
<p>In order to ease and enhance the development of MyBB 2.0, we are utilising Unit Tests via <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a>. This allows us to automatically test our code to ensure fewer bugs and issues caused by our development. To take this even further, we're also using a continuous integration service called CircleCI. CircleCI automatically runs our Unit Tests and checks our code style every time that we commit code to the MyBB 2.0 core, ensuring all of our developers are following the same standards to produce a clear and maintainable codebase.</p>
<p>This integration will also be rolled out to all third party contributors as the MyBB 2.0 repositories become public, which is something we'll be talking more about in the future. We just wanted to give you a heads up now so that developers can know what to expect when the time comes.</p>

<h2>Profile Field Enhancements</h2>
<p>Profile fields in MyBB 2.0 have received a much needed update. Profile fields can be organised within groups, and can be a configured to use a variety of different input types. In addition, profile fields can also have validation rules to ensure only certain types of data can be entered by users. Some of the currently supported field types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select - a drop down box of options from which a single value can be chosen.</li>
<li>Text - A simple textbox.</li>
<li>Email - A textbox allowing only valid email addresses.</li>
<li>URL - A textbox allowing only valid URLs.</li>
<li>Number - A numerical input box, with up/down arrows.</li>
<li>Text Area - A simple text area to input larger amounts of text.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these different input types will use semantic HTML5 input types, and we plan to add support for running the parser upon profile fields and using the rich text (WYSIWYG) editor.</p>

<h2>Quoting a small subsection of a post</h2>
<p>Quotes are an integral part of the forum experience - being able to respond to another post whilst keeping the context of that post eases inter-member communication. In MyBB 1.x, we've had the ability to quote multiple posts and single posts in full, in MyBB 2.0 we're taking this a step further. In addition to quoting single and multiple quotes, you can now also select a section of text and automatically quote it within a reply. This greatly speeds up interactions and should be a welcome addition for many users.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2543" align="alignnone" width="640"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/screenshot_quick-quote.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2543 size-large" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot_quick-quote.jpg?w=640" alt="Quote the selection" width="640" height="126" /></a> Quoting a small subsection of a post[/caption]</p>
<h2>Parser enhancements</h2>
<p>We've been working hard to enhance and improve the post parser. Parsing MyCode has traditionally been one of the slowest parts of MyBB - and one of the most prone to issues. With MyBB 2.0, we're aiming to provide a parser that is not only faster, but is also fully unit tested and much more reliable. In addition, the parser will also be picking up some new features - such as the ability to handle <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> as an alternative to MyCode.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future - community interaction</h2>
<p>Over the last months, we've been trying to improve the way that the staff team interacts with the community at large. Starting this dev post series was one step towards improving this interaction, then we started organising the 2.0 suggestions forum to make our direction more clear. We've started making steps to being more open, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to be holding public RFCs (Requests for Comments) regarding the direction of MyBB and some of our planned features. This will allow community members to have their say, and to see the direction in which MyBB is headed.</p>
<p>We're also looking for volunteers to help us improve the current MyBB documentation and, when the time comes, to help us write a full suite of documentation for MyBB 2.0. We'll be writing a post with more details about how you can contribute to the documentation soon, so keep your eyes stuck to the blog.</p>

        <p>It’s that time again, time for another MyBB 2.0 dev blog! This post is the third in a series of development update posts regarding MyBB 2.0.  Currently in pre-alpha, MyBB 2.0 is the long awaited upcoming major version of the open source MyBB forum software.  We’ll be posting regular updates (we promise!) in regards to the development to keep you all updated. The development team have been hard at work since <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2015/04/13/2-0-dev-post-2/">our last dev post</a>, adding new features and polishing existing functionality. This post will explore some of these new features and highlight our approach to the development of the system.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>New approach to feature suggestions</h2>
<p>Some of you who frequent our <a href="http://community.mybb.com">community forums</a> may have noticed the newly reorganised <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-166.html">MyBB 2.0 Development forum</a>. The new structure makes it far easier to suggest new features and enhancements, and to track the currently confirmed and planned features we are implementing. Previously, the suggestions forum has been hectic and unorganised with no clear structure. I hope you agree that this more structured approach is for the better for all of us, but please do suggest any additional changes that you think might help.</p>
<h2>Some Development Background</h2>
<p>We've been trying to provide some background on how we're actually developing MyBB 2.0 as part of this series rather than just using it to look at features and such. In this post, I'd like to talk about how we're working on the front-end of the software - namely the CSS stylesheets and the JavaScript.</p>
<p>During the development stages for 2.0, we're utilising <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> to develop the core theme. Sass brings a whole lot more flexibility to the table, and is allowing us to rapidly work on the style and make use of useful features such as CSS variables for colours and mixing to provide common rule sets. We chose Sass due to its easy to learn syntax and rich feature set, though we also considered alternatives such as LESS.</p>
<p>We're also trying to follow the <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/">BEM syntax</a> for the core theme, in an effort to make the CSS classes used in the core much more understandable to other developers and to make the reuse of useful classes far easier.</p>
<p>We're also currently investigating how easy it would be to provide the use of Sass and LESS to theme authors straight from the Admin Control Panel. This would give theme developers a great deal more flexibility, and would see Sass or LESS being used to create a theme, with the compiled CSS served up to end users.</p>
<p>Our approach to JavaScript at the moment still uses raw JavaScript (rather than a language such as CoffeeScript or TypeScript that compiles to JavaScript), though all JavaScript components are being written as separate modules under a global "MyBB" namespace. We're also still making use of jQuery, though the version has been bumped to version 2.1.4 as of the time of writing.</p>
<p>Here's a taster of this new approach to writing our JavaScript, as seen in our MyBB.Spinner module:</p>
<p>[code language="javascript"]<br />
(function ($, window) {<br />
   window.MyBB = window.MyBB || {};</p>
<p>   window.MyBB.Spinner = {<br />
      inProgresses: 0,<br />
      add: function () {<br />
         this.inProgresses++;<br />
         if (this.inProgresses == 1) {<br />
            $(&quot;#spinner&quot;).show();<br />
         }<br />
      },<br />
      remove: function () {<br />
         this.inProgresses--;<br />
         if (this.inProgresses == 0) {<br />
            $(&quot;#spinner&quot;).hide();<br />
         }<br />
      }<br />
   }<br />
})<br />
(jQuery, window);<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>In order to aid the process of compiling our SASS files and combining our JavaScript modules, we're making use of the <a href="http://gulpjs.com">gulp.js build system</a>. This system compiles our SASS stylesheets into CSS, saves them and then minifies then into "*.min.css" files for use in the main theme. It also combines all of the JavaScript files (including vendor scripts such as jQuery) and minifies them too, along with optimising all of the images used by the theme.</p>
<p>This whole process is allowing for a rapid iteration of the front-end development and design of MyBB 2.0, and we look forward to bringing some of this power to theme developers and site owners. We're currently intending to have an Admin Control Panel area under the Templates and Styles module to allow the management of JavaScript files rather than requiring manual template edits. This, combined with the automatic minifying of source files and the use of CDNs being made far easier should offer administrators much more flexibility and provide a welcome speed boat to the loading of forum pages.</p>
<h2> Private Conversations</h2>
<p>MyBB has long had the ability to send other members Private Messages, which are hidden from public view. This system has become rather restrictive in recent times though, with the PM system only showing the last message and allowing only two participants. We therefore decided for MyBB 2.0 to overhaul this system to act as a much more powerful Conversation based system.</p>
<p>This new system allows for multiple participants within a conversation, and a fully threaded approach to messages. This allows for much greater communications between users in private outside of the usual forums.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2518" align="aligncenter" width="660"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-11-27.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2518" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-11-27.png?w=660" alt="A sample Private Conversation, with several participants taking part." width="660" height="392" /></a> A sample Private Conversation, with several participants taking part.[/caption]</p>
<h2>Redesigned User Control Panel</h2>
<p>The User Control Panel in MyBB is the one-stop place for users to manage their details, update their signature and avatar, edit their preferences and more. In MyBB 2.0, it has received a significant redesign and overhaul in order to simplify the way things are presented to the user.</p>
<p>The Control Panel maintains its sidebar (and the easy extensibility it provides for plugin developers), but trims down the default entries by combining items that may be combined. In addition, the section to manage your Private Messages has been removed, and is instead accessible via the conversations management page and the conversations drop-down menu found in the header of all pages.</p>
<p>Most of a user's details are configured via a single "Profile" page within the new User Control Panel. This page also shows all custom user profile fields configured by the board administrator, allowing users to fill in all of their details in one single easily accessible location.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2520" align="aligncenter" width="660"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-19-13.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2520" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-19-13.png?w=660" alt="The new User Control Panel, showing the Profile management page.

<p>[caption id="attachment_2521" align="aligncenter" width="660"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-19-20.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-2521" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-05-30-at-23-19-20.png?w=660" alt="Some of the administrator configured custom profile fields.

Fields can be grouped together and shown under different headings, as well as having validation rules attached, being set to be required and having several different input types.[/caption]</p>
<p>Custom profile fields have been greatly enhanced in MyBB 2.0 and should replace the functionality provided by many plugins used with MyBB 1.8 today. We're looking forward to covering this additional functionality in more depth in future blog posts.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Well, that’s it for this month’s MyBB 2.0 development progress post. As you can hopefully see, the team has been hard at work and listening to user feedback. If you have any suggestions, post them in a comment or in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-152.html">2.0 suggestion forum</a>, but please do remember to follow the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-170791.html">new guidelines for posting suggestions</a>! We still have a lot more to both announce and to show, so keep your eyes tuned to the blog for future updates.</p>

<h2>Some development background</h2>
<p>As we announced in our previous post, MyBB 2.0 is being developed using the Laravel 5.0 PHP framework, and utilising the Twig templating engine. In this post, we want to explore some of the more specific development practices and techniques that we are using in order to prepare third party developers for what's to come. In MyBB 2.0, we have decided to follow the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2 coding style</a>, meaning our code styling rules of old are to be abandoned with the 1.x series of releases. This change means that the code behind MyBB follows a common standard followed by many other modern PHP applications, meaning switching between differing platforms during development should be far simpler. Additionally, MyBB 2.0 follows the <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR-4 autoloading standard</a> and utilises the <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer dependency manager</a> to manage third party libraries and dependencies. Both of the above are common standards and tools used to develop modern PHP applications and should provide a much easier entrance to writing extensions and modifications for the MyBB platform. As part of the development process, several core components of the core MyBB system are being split off into separate packages. This allows core components from MyBB which were previously tightly coupled to the main codebase to be easily used in other projects. So far, we have split packages for parsing posts from BBCode to HTML (and performing filtering on said parsed HTML), as well as our core settings package. As we progress, other core components will be split into reusable packages and released for public use. All of these packages will feature a full set of unit tests and documentation for usage and will be installable within any Composer based project. This means that projects building upon a MyBB core can easily utilise well tested components core to their forum platform and build on top of the solid base we have already provided. In the future, we will be doing development posts focusing on individual packages that are available for use, including examine their package structure and the features they provide. This will start next month with a look at our core settings package, which provides both general board settings and individual user settings.</p>
<h2>And now for a quick look at some of our new features</h2>
<p>So for everyone who's managed to stick with us so far, here's what you've been really looking forward to - screenshot time! In this section we'll have a look at one of the new commonly requested features coming to MyBB 2.0 and at the new look some existing features have received.</p>
<h3>Liking content</h3>
<p>The ability to like content has long been a requested feature in the MyBB core, as has been evidenced by the large number of third party plugins that provide just such functionality. We're glad to acknowledge that this functionality is now a core feature in MyBB 2.0 and upgrading boards will have all existing reputation points received for posts converted to these new likes. <a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-18-52.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2471" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-18-52.png?w=660" alt="Liking a post in MyBB 2.0." width="660" height="125" /></a> For developers, it's extremely easy to add the ability to like content to their own custom code. This means that third party systems such as image galleries can easily add the ability to like their content with only a few lines of code, as can be seen below.</p>
<p>[code language="php"]<br />
&lt;?php</p>
<p>namespace MyBB\Core\Database\Models;</p>
<p>use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;<br />
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;<br />
use MyBB\Core\Likes\Traits\LikeableTrait;</p>
<p>class Post extends Model implements HasPresenter<br />
{<br />
	use SoftDeletes;<br />
	use LikeableTrait;</p>
<p>	// The rest of your database model implementation code goes here...<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This should mean that this feature will be extremely common across third party applications and extensions. This approach to easy extension and customisability has always been at the core of MyBB, and we aim to keep it so throughout the lifetime of 2.0.</p>
<h3>The new look member list</h3>
<p>As with the rest of MyBB 2.0, the old member list has received quite a face lift. Rather than the tabular list of old showing very few details, members are now presented as individual user cards, with their personal avatars given front and centre. <a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-28-27.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2472" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-28-27.png?w=660" alt="The MyBB 2.0 user list" width="660" height="254" /></a></p>
<h3>The new look forum view</h3>
<p>What's a forum system without forums? In MyBB 2.0, the forum overview has received a minor facelift, and the commonly requested feature of showing the avatar of the last user to post a reply to a topic has been integrated into the core. The approach to the forum view is to offer a minimalistic approach to bringing your content to the forefront. It is for this reason that there is very little clutter or extraneous information presented - we want to bring what really matters straight to the attention of your users. <a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-31-20.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2473" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-04-13-at-23-31-20.png?w=660" alt="MyBB 2.0 Forum View" width="660" height="234" /></a></p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Well, that's it for this month's MyBB 2.0 development progress post. As you can hopefully see, the team has been hard at work and listening to user feedback. If you have any suggestions, post them in a comment or in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-152.html">2.0 suggestion forum</a>. We still have a lot more to both announce and to show, so keep your eyes tuned to the blog for future updates.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>We have been working extremely hard behind the scenes for the last few months, and are pleased to now lift the covers upon the future of MyBB, and forums, to you the public. We feel assured that this new direction will both excite and amaze, and help us reach even more users across the world.<!--more--></p>
<p>May we present to you, the brand new <a title="MyBBWatch - New Horizons for MyBB 2.0" href="http://watch.mybb.com" target="_blank">MyBBWatch</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2458" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/mybb_watch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2458" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/mybb_watch.png?w=300" alt="Meet the MyBB Watch - watch.mybb.com" width="300" height="169" /></a> Meet the MyBBWatch, an innovative approach to community interaction and discussion.[/caption]</p>
<p>The MyBBWatch brings community interaction and discussion to your wrist, no matter where you are. No more worries about cross browser compatibilities for your forum theme, as all smart watch platforms are supported by officially managed applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MyBBWatch provides the ability to run as a hosted service upon our own cloud servers. Never worry about downtime or server management again! Base packages, offering unlimited users and discussions are available at no cost, with an advanced package providing full professional support available from only $19 USD a month.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2460" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/screen-shot-2015-03-31-at-14-23-55.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2460" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screen-shot-2015-03-31-at-14-23-55.png?w=300" alt="Available Plans for MyBBWatch - watch.mybb.com" width="300" height="115" /></a> The full range of pans offered with the new MyBBWatch service.[/caption]</p>
<p>The new MyBBWatch is of course fully customisable with new designs, modules and plugins, as you are used to from prior releases.MyBBWatch is also just as easy to install as ever before, with minimum requirements being PHP 5.8 and a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. However, all support for Linux based servers has been officially dropped due to recent security scares involving software such as OpenSSL. From here onwards, the MyBBWatch will run only on the Windows family of Operating Systems, with Windows Server 2012 being the recommended base Operating System.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited for the future of MyBB as we are, we're all eagerly anticipating an early Q4, 2015 release. Keep tuned to the blog for more information and demos in the future.</p>

        <p>This will be the first of a series of development update posts regarding MyBB 2.0.  Currently in pre-alpha, MyBB 2.0 is the long awaited upcoming major version of the open source MyBB forum software.  We’ll be posting regular updates (we promise!) in regards to the development to keep you all updated.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Development Cycle</strong></p>
<p>Being a pre-alpha, many basic functions of forum software are not yet implemented.  Right now, all development is being done in private by a subset of the development team led by Euan T.  Once we have a working software with all the basics, the alpha release will be announced and we will open up the GitHub repo and the community at large will be able to begin contributing.  Once the majority of features have been implemented a beta will be released, and after that, a gold 2.0 will be let loose!</p>
<p>Currently no public timeframe is on the table.  We have an internal roadmap, but we'd rather not disappoint the public if we fail to make one of our milestones.  As always it will be released when it's ready.  That being said, from the dev blog posts you should be able to make educated guesses.</p>
<p><strong>What We Have</strong></p>
<p>Here's the juicy content you've all been waiting for.  MyBB 2.0 is being coded in PHP, using the Laravel 5 framework and the Twig templating engine.  Various screenshots of 2.0 prototypes have been posted to MyBB's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MyBBoard" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/MyBB" target="_blank">Twitter</a> social media pages, revealing a long anticipated and rumored responsive theme.  "Pretty" URLs are available out of the box, taking the form "/topic/me-thread.1", along with several other useful tools aimed at enhancing the search engine optimisation of the software such as relevant meta tags and canonical links. In addition, the new default theme makes use of semantic HTML5 elements, rather than the old and now defunct table-based layout that's been a part of MyBB since the early days.</p>
<p>Here's some screenshots of a super-secret development copy live on the Internet somewhere (don't bother looking for it; it's protected by HTTP auth and a rather obscure URL).</p>
<p>Everyone's favorite features, /me and /slap, are live in the very first 2.0 "/me topic".  By the way - we've transitioned from the old, usenet email group term of "thread" and changed the language to say "topic", a much more modern and relevant term.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/mybb21.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2453" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/mybb21.png?w=660" alt="mybb21" width="660" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>Buttons, as you can see, are provided in SVG format by fontawesome.  Another thing you may notice is the timestamps seem to be rather archaic; have no fear, relative time and more human readable dates are on the way.</p>
<p>This is by no means all that has been implemented so far, but as we plan on having regular dev posts we'll save some for a later date!</p>
<p>We as a team are very excited by the prospects of MyBB 2.0 and are looking forward to a very exciting future. We hope that you too can share in this excitement with us and keep making MyBB great.</p>

        <p>The MyBB Merge System for 1.8 is <a href="http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/merge_1.8.00.zip">now available</a> from the MyBB website.</p>
<h1>What's new in this version?</h1>
<p>First we decided to drop some old modules which aren't supported by their developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBPress 1</li>
<li>IP.Board 2</li>
<li>Mingle</li>
<li>phpBB 2</li>
<li>vBulletin 3</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course we've added more new modules (including some which you requested fairly often in the past)</p>
<ul>
<li>BBPress 2</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board Lite 2</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board 3</li>
<li>WoltLab Burning Board 4</li>
<li>IP.Board 3</li>
<li>IP.Board 4 (Based on the latest Preview Release)</li>
<li>vBulletin 4</li>
<li>FluxBB</li>
<li>XenForo</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, we fixed finally a lot of known issues with the merge system: <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.8.0">Fixed Bugs</a><br />
But (as always) there're still some <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue">Known Bugs</a>.</p>
<h1>Translations and the Merge System</h1>
<p>Till now the Merge System was only available in english, however we decided to make the Merge System translatable too. The language file is located at "merge/language/".</p>
<h1>Help us!</h1>
<p>You can report bugs and help us with the development at <a href="https://github.com/mybb/merge-system/">GitHub</a> but even if you can't code you can help us with sending us some sample databases (more infos on the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-158645.html">forums</a>).</p>

        <p>Guess what? The 3rd and last Beta version of MyBB 1.8 is out! After this version (unless something very bad or unexpected happens), we're rolling out 1.8.0 Stable/Gold for all of you. We need your help testing Beta 3 though so we can release 1.8.0 as stable as possible.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ba0f00;">NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT READY TO BE USED ON A LIVE WEBSITE.</span></strong></p>
<p>You can see the currently open issues for Gold <a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues?direction=desc&amp;labels=1.8&amp;milestone=2&amp;page=1&amp;sort=updated&amp;state=open">here</a>.</p>
<p>Color legend:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#0059ba;">Dark Blue</span> - Small (new) feature/change</li>
<li><span style="color:#0090ff;">Light Blue</span> - Enhancement</li>
<li><span style="color:#ff6e00;">Orange</span> - New Feature</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're <strong>not</strong> mentioning bug fixes below (the same bug fixes applied to the 1.6 branch are also applied to 1.8 as of now and the bugs for 1.8 only are not mentioned as that would only be important if 1.8 was already stable.), only small feature changes, enhancements and entirely new features.</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements mentioned below are related to the previous Beta versions (1st and 2nd) of 1.8 and they should appear as one only in the final list of enhancements for MyBB 1.8.</p>

<h4>Download</h4>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ba0f00;">ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT READY TO BE USED ON A LIVE WEBSITE! DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR LIVE WEBSITE TO THIS VERSION.</span></strong></p>
<p>The download can be found <a href="http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/18/beta/MyBB%201.8%20Beta%203.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Upgrade</h4>
<p>You are <em><strong>NOT</strong> </em>supposed to upgrade any 1.6 boards to 1.8 Beta 3 hence why we do not provide upgrading instructions. This is because you will not be able to upgrade from any of the Betas to 1.8. While we've done some work on the upgrader to guarantee that users no longer experience errors, this hasn't been tested thoroughly. This is our number one priority in the next development phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bug Reports</h4>
<p>Found a bug? (or perhaps a few more...) Please post your <strong>detailed</strong> bug report in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-157.html">1.8 Bug Reports forum</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please always double-check</strong> if the issue hasn't been reported already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Themes and Plugins Assistance</h4>
<p>If you have any <strong>development</strong> questions about possible issues you may have while upgrading your themes or your plugins - or issues you may actually be having - please post in <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-156.html">this forum</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Contributors</h4>
<p>We'd like to thank the following contributors, they have been exceptional during the 1.8 development:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="martec" href="https://github.com/martec">martec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ATofighi">ATofighi</a></li>

</ul>
<p>They have created many Pull Requests, they helped us out solving bugs and finishing features and took part in many discussions on GitHub. MyBB is no longer a product developed by the team only, but by the community as well.</p>

<p>According to our plans there will be only one more Beta version (3rd) after this one - after that we'll hit Gold/Stable. You can see the currently open issues for Beta 3 <a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues?labels=1.8&amp;milestone=6&amp;state=open">here</a>.</p>

<li><span style="color:#0090ff;">Light Blue</span> - Enhancement</li>
<li><span style="color:#ff6e00;">Orange</span> - New Feature</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're <strong>not</strong> mentioning bug fixes below (the same bug fixes applied to the 1.6 branch are also applied to 1.8 as of now and the bugs for 1.8 only are not mentioned as that would only be important if 1.8 was already stable.), only small feature changes, enhancements and entirely new features.</p>
<p>Some of the enhancements mentioned below are related to the previous Beta version (1st) of 1.8 and they should appear as one only in the final list of enhancements for MyBB 1.8.</p>

<h4>Download</h4>
<p><strong><span style="color:#ba0f00;">ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS NOT READY TO BE USED ON A LIVE WEBSITE! DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR LIVE WEBSITE TO THIS VERSION.</span></strong></p>
<p>The download can be found <a href="http://resources.mybb.com/downloads/18/beta/MyBB%201.8%20Beta%202.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Upgrade</h4>
<p>You are NOT supposed to upgrade any 1.6 boards to 1.8 Beta 2 hence why we do not provide upgrading instructions. This is because you will not be able to upgrade from any of the Betas to 1.8 AND because the upgrader is not working yet (right...so you try it and it won't work anyway and you will definitely break your board. So DON'T DO IT!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bug Reports</h4>
<p>Found a bug? (or perhaps a few more...) Please post your <strong>detailed</strong> bug report in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-157.html">1.8 Bug Reports forum</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Please always double-check</strong> if the issue hasn't been reported already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Themes and Plugins Assistance</h4>
<p>If you have any <strong>development</strong> questions about possible issues you may have while upgrading your themes or your plugins - or issues you may actually be having - please post in <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-156.html">this forum</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What's next?</h4>
<p>Work will now be moved to <a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb/issues?labels=&amp;milestone=6">Beta 3</a> so we can release 1.8 gold/stable this summer as planned. Meanwhile, 2.0 development meetings have started so we can start working on 2.0 full time as soon as 1.8 hits stable.</p>

        <p>That's right. After a long time of waiting we're getting near a 1.8 stable release. Today it's with great pleasure that we're releasing the first beta version of MyBB 1.8. <strong><span style="color:#ba0f00;">NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT READY TO BE USED ON A LIVE WEBSITE.</span></strong></p>

        <p>With the release of MyBB 1.6.13, the team felt there was a need to address some issues that affect the future of the Project, the Community and the Team in general.</p>
<h4>Developers and MyBB Development Workflow</h4>
<p>With the departure of Nathan and Tomm, MyBB has once again found itself in need of active team members. This, along with the unavailability of most current developers due to time constraints caused by life issues, led to us breaking our workflow, which as you may have noticed ended up delaying the release of MyBB 1.6.13. After MyBB 1.6.13 was out, work on 1.8 Beta 1 has been resumed (and you can clearly see that by examining the commits made for on github in the 'feature' branch).</p>
<h4><strong>Moving forward with 2.0.</strong></h4>
<p>Initially 1.6 was supposed to lead to 2.0 directly, but with the team feeling that 2.0 was still in very early development, MyBB would lose to its competitors for quite a bit of time (the development time of 2.0). Thus, work was put into "modernizing" the look and feel of 1.6 before the complete rewrite, and so 1.8 was born. As anticipated, this has delayed work on 2.0 of course. Once 1.8 is released (Beta 1 is nearing its completion; at time of writing only one feature is left to finish: jQuery conversion; all the other open issues aimed for Beta 1 are bugs) work will start on 2.0. There has been a lot of talk of MyBB being a "<em>dead project"</em>, but this is very far from the truth. As an open source project, as long as we have active developers, the project will never be "<em>dead".</em> But we need the community's help - we've been helping you for a long time, we're asking you to help us now  - so if you feel that you know MyBB pretty well but most of all, if you feel that you have value to give to the team and project, contact us!</p>
<h4><strong>Changes that we are implementing now</strong></h4>
<p>It became apparent to us, that one of the major problems we have had was losing key team leaders. As you may remember, we recently <em>got rid of </em>the "Team Leader" role, and went with a more equal structure. This did not promote (as we had intended) productivity. So we have come up with a new system, whereby developers will take turns taking the "<em>lead" </em>on a per version basis. This will keep them all updated with the procedures required to package and release new versions. We are pleased to announce the <strong><a title="Stefan T. - I shall grant thee 1.6.14" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-2824.html" target="_blank">Stefan T</a></strong> will be assuming the role of Lead Developer first and and the next should be <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8582.html">Pirata Nervo</a> (after that a new internal poll will be made). We are also pleased to announce that <strong><a title="King Louis - King of SQA" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-57502.html" target="_blank">King Louis</a></strong> will be assuming the position of SQA team lead (the leader here doesn't change as we believe the SQA team requires a static leader).</p>
<h4><strong>Recruitment</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, we are now looking for more active members for both Development, Support, and more importantly SQA (we're running low here!).  If you feel that you would be a good addition to the team, why not submit some pull requests on Github and/or drop an application to using the <strong><a title="Contact form" href="http://www.mybb.com/contact?subject=team-position" target="_blank">contact form</a>, </strong>posting a thread in <strong><a title="Post a thread in this forum that only YOU and US can see..." href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html" target="_blank">Private Inquiries</a> (recommended) </strong>or even by <em>PM'ing </em><a title="If I don't respond within 24 hours I will owe you a cookie." href="http://community.mybb.com/private.php?action=send&amp;uid=12694" target="_blank"><strong>us</strong></a>.  You cand read more about the responsibilities <strong><a title="Apply for the Team" href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply" target="_blank">here</a>. Do not be afraid of contacting us, we won't bite you - but we'll be always be honest with you.<br />

        <p>As we move closer to the first beta release of MyBB 1.8 the MyBB Team have been hard at work streamlining some of our behind-the-scenes services and workflows.</p>
<h4>Changes to Development</h4>
<p>A while ago we mentioned moving to a GitFlow workflow over at our GitHub repository. If you’re interested in helping us develop everyone’s favourite forum software take a <a title="MyBB Development Workflow" href="http://community.mybb.com/announcement-25.html" target="_blank">look at our new Development Workflow</a> and how you can get involved.</p>
<p>MyBB 1.6.x will now start using this workflow. MyBB 1.8.x will start using this when it reaches its first beta phase.</p>
<h4>Timed Releases</h4>
<p>With our new workflow the master branch in our repository should always be production ready. While only the latest release, available from MyBB.com, is supported on our support forums this allows us to provide set dates for bug fixes and maintenance releases.</p>
<p>You should see new MyBB releases every two months from January 2014 regardless of how many issues are resolved. So you can expect 1.6.13 in March ‘14, 1.6.14 in May ’14 and so on. There is no limit to how many versions we’ll have in the 1.6.x series until its EOL date.</p>
<p>Security releases remain unaffected and patches/releases are created whenever high risk vulnerabilities are reported and fixed.</p>
<h4>Reporting Bugs and Issues in MyBB 1.x</h4>
<p>One of the last remaining legacies of MyBB’s development cycles, Redmine, is now officially retired and no new members or issues can be created.</p>
<p>Instead, you can now report bugs and issues you find in MyBB in two ways: via the Community Forums (in the <a title="MyBB 1.6 Bugs &amp; Issues" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-126.html" target="_blank">1.6 Bugs &amp; Issues forum</a> or the <a title="MyBB 1.8 Bugs and Issues" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-157.html" target="_blank">1.8 Bugs &amp; Issues forum</a>) or directly at GitHub.</p>
<p>In the near future we’ll be moving all existing open issues to GitHub and archiving Redmine. At the moment existing users there can still comment and act on issues.</p>
<h4>Becoming a Contributor</h4>
<p>The MyBB Team will also be moving development discussions about the core into the open development sections on our Community Forums. To be able to start new threads and reply to these discussions you need to join our new Contributor group.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the <a title="Joining the Contributor Group" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-149160.html" target="_blank">Joining the Contributor Group</a> thread.</p>
<h4>Moving 1.8 to Beta</h4>
<p>Finally, we’re almost there. After almost 2 long years the MyBB Team have been busy finishing up the last remaining roadmap items for the first beta phase of MyBB 1.8.</p>
<p>Even at this exciting (and long overdue) stage there are still many tasks left to complete before you should be using 1.8 on your live forum.</p>
<p>Why not <a title="Download MyBB 1.7" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-138326.html" target="_blank">download a copy of MyBB 1.7 today</a> and give it a test drive on your localhost – and <a title="MyBB 1.8 Suggestions &amp; Feedback" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-158.html" target="_blank">let us know what you think</a>!</p>

The aim of this release is to introduce a level of standardisation and organisation that MyBB has previously lacked and to bring the series into line with other products and services that we hope to bring to you in the near future.</p>
<p>1.8 is a huge leap forward for the 1.x series. It will introduce some powerful new features while also providing a stable forum solution for your community for years to come. It will also allow us, the MyBB Group, to focus on the next generation of our software - the anticipated 2.x series.</p>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Due to the extended development and testing phase of 1.6.10, as well as the usual lull in activity due to workload, exams and holidays, MyBB 1.8 isn’t as far along its roadmap as we would like. Naturally we are disappointed but we remain committed to creating and providing one of the most advanced free forum software packages available.</p>
<p>Further to this we are, as a group, undergoing huge changes to how we work to help make releases quicker. These past 12 months has seen an insane amount of work completed by our team, much of which is behind-the-scenes, and we hope to bring news of this to you very soon.</p>
<p>With updates in mind, you can now find the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-138326.html" target="_blank"><strong>MyBB 1.8 Roadmap on our community forums</strong></a>. This thread will be kept up to date with the latest news, features and bug fixes that are happening during its development.</p>
<h4>Release Date</h4>
<p>As always, MyBB 1.8 will be released when we feel it is ready. We opened our GitHub project to the public so that anyone - not just the MyBB Team - can help with development of the 1.x series. Even if you can’t code, anyone can download both branches (1.6 &amp; 1.8) to help test bugs and offer suggestions for improvements. Alongside our roadmap you can keep up to date with the project and see what is coming next.</p>
<p>1.8 is not feature locked at this moment in time. However, we don’t plan on introducing further major overhauls to help avoid plugin and theme incompatibilities. </p>
<h4>Joining the Team</h4>
<p>There has never been a more exciting time in MyBB’s history; with 1.6 ready for new technologies, 1.8 on the way and starting 2.x soon (which is looking absolutely awesome) 2013 is already proving to be a busy year. If you feel you have got what it takes to be a dedicated volunteer for the project we’d love to have you on the team!</p>
<p>We’re currently looking for developers for the 1.x series, SQA team members and members for our new Resources Team - who will be focused on managing our community services. If you are interested in any of these PM a staff member, post an application in our <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">Private Inquiries forum</a> or <a href="http://www.mybb.com/contact">send us an email</a>.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Back in June 2012, after our <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2012/06/03/access-to-community-forums-restored-modifications-site-underway-updates-faq/" target="_blank">MyBB.com domain was hijacked</a>, we removed public access to our development repositories and moved to GitHub.</p>
<p>Today we are pleased to announce that our main repository, where the 1.x series is developed, is now available to the public!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb" target="_blank"><strong>Visit the MyBB repository on GitHub →</strong></a></p>
<h4>The Basics</h4>
<p>The <em>mybb</em> repository consists of 3 main branches: Master, Stable and Feature. These branches contain a different set of code depending on the name of the branch.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master</strong> contains code that has been (or is to be) publically released (currently 1.6.9)</li>
<li><strong>Stable</strong> contains work and bug fixes for the next minor version of MyBB (so 1.6.10, 1.6.11 etc)</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> contains all our work on the next feature version of MyBB - 1.8</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that, although all this work is available to you, MyBB only officially supports the latest release. Stable and Feature code may contain partially-committed features which are broken, incomplete or may never make it to public release and for these reasons we do not recommend using either of these branches on your own forums.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>They will NOT be supported by the Support Team.</strong></span></p>
<h4>For Developers</h4>
<p>Access to our repository provides plugin and theme developers the opportunity to work with the latest code. We hope members of our community, and those interested in our project, become more closely involved with MyBB’s development.</p>
<p>Cutting edge development is designed for advanced users only. While we will try and support you with your work MyBB can’t provide support for Git or GitHub. We’re working on improving our documentation about development.</p>
<h4>About MyBB 1.8 Alpha</h4>
<p>With the opening of our repository MyBB 1.8 is now publically available via the Feature branch. Please note that this only contains a handful of optimizations, features and changes that we are going to implement into this series.</p>
<p>Major features, such as the Report Centre, Spam Centre and our jQuery conversion are just starting to be worked on but accessing 1.8 should, however, give you an idea of the direction we’re heading in and what we’re trying to achieve with this version of MyBB. It should also allow developers to keep on track with what changes we’re making and, with that in mind, we do encourage anyone interested in working with 1.8 to get involved or get in touch via the 1.8 sections on our forum (coming soon).</p>
<h4>Getting Involved</h4>
<p>To get involved with MyBB development you will first need a GitHub account. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the repository</li>
<li>If you want to fix a bug - switch to the <em>stable</em> branch</li>
<li>If you want to work with 1.8 - switch to the <em>feature</em> branch</li>
<li>Make your changes (ensuring you follow the MyBB Development Standards) and push them to your forked repository</li>
<li>Send us a <a title="Sending Pull Requests" href="https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/" target="_blank">pull request</a> via GitHub with your changes and make sure you reference the issue ticket number your changes relate to (update the ticket too to tell us you’ve fixed it)</li>
<li>SQA will provide feedback and, if it passes verification, your changes are merged into MyBB</li>
</ul>
<h4>GitHub Issues to replace Redmine</h4>
<p>At the moment MyBB uses Redmine to <a href="http://dev.mybb.com" target="_blank">power our issue tracker</a>. Over time, we will be migrating to use GitHub’s inbuilt Issues tracker to provide closer integration between the repository and reported issues. It should also create a one-point resource for all development.</p>
<p>We’re starting this migration with MyBB 1.8. If you find a bug or problem within the feature branch you should first report it in the MyBB 1.8 Bugs &amp; Issues forum. This allows members of the community to discuss the issue and confirm that it is, in fact, a bug. Once confirmed, a member of the MyBB Team will use a clever custom plugin (developed by Nathan Malcolm) to move the issue to GitHub for developers to work on a fix.</p>
<p>The new workflow eliminates the need for a separate account on Redmine and should allow more members to contribute towards development.</p>
<p>The MyBB 1.8 sections on the Community Forum will be available soon. In the mean time, please use the <a title="Suggestions &amp; Feedback" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-7.html" target="_blank">MyBB 1.6/1.8 Suggestions &amp; Feedback</a> forum.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>There is a lot of new information here but it’s just the start of a new journey for MyBB and our community. By improving reporting methods, making it possible for non-team members to contribute and continuing to work on our new series we feel confident that MyBB will continue to be the best free forum software for years to come.</p>
<p>With thanks,</p>
<p>The MyBB Team</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>As MyBB approaches its 10th-year anniversary it's quite easy for us to dwell on history. Even with the changes we're working on in MyBB 1.8 you can still compare the early versions of our product to our next major release and see that they are made from the same group of people. Despite the dozens of Developers, SQA Testers, Support Team members, PR guys and Management we've had over this time, who have each made their mark in their own way, the consistency of MyBB as a forum system at its core is one of the fundamental mantras of the MyBB Group.</p>
<p>With that in mind, whenever we do come to develop around a feature, we're cautious to remove the legacy it might leave behind. It is often a tough decision between moving forward and embracing something new and doing what we know. MyBB 1.8 gives us a great chance to look around and research how to improve these features for our users; with around 40 planned research projects into different areas of MyBB we're aiming to bring a higher level of usability and functionality to your forum.</p>
<h4>Avatar Changes</h4>
<p>With <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>, an avatar hosting service, being integrated into Wordpress, Redmine and GitHub (alongside other websites and many 3rd party addons for other software) it brings together an opportunity for us to provide a consistent platform for users to have the same look wherever they go. In MyBB 1.8 you can now use your Gravatar email in the Avatar URL field. Options in the ACP allow Administrators to control the content of avatars with Gravatar's age-based rating systems.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1925" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/g548rw.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1925" title="Changing Avatar" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/g548rw.png?w=300" alt="Changing Avatar" width="300" height="101" /></a> The MyBB 1.8 Change Avatar[/caption]</p>
<p>Alongside Gravatar is our new format_avatar function. This introduces the ability to pass a user's avatar information to a single function to work out the correct dimensions to display on the page; it also means we aren't parsing the same avatar twice for the same user on the same page. If the user has no avatar set Administrators are able to set a default avatar from the ACP to use instead.</p>
<p>These changes do come with some sad news; in MyBB 1.8, we've removed the avatar gallery feature. We'll all be disappointed to see the end of Supertux and Mr Spam but we thought it best to keep a clear and simple method to change user avatars in which the avatar gallery was a much non-used feature to the majority of forums.</p>
<h4>News and Version Check Changes</h4>
<p>One of the main aims of MyBB 1.8 is to help improve the services we offer to our own users. This involves keeping users up to date about what's happening and new versions of MyBB.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1926" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bb8fc.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1926" title="News Feed in the ACP" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/bb8fc.png?w=300" alt="News Feed in the ACP" width="300" height="157" /></a> News Feed in the ACP[/caption]</p>
<p>In the ACP, we've introduced a small news feed into the Dashboard. We've also moved the Version Check, which used to have its own section, into the Dashboard too so that all updates are in the same place right in front of administrators. A new task is to be added to regularly check for any updates (versions and news) rather than relying on users to catch the 'Your last version check was...' message that may otherwise be easily missed.</p>
<h4>The Little Things</h4>
<p>Some of the other, smaller changes to MyBB 1.8 come to fix those trivial things people may (or may not) have noticed. These include removing the option to rate your own thread and changing trim() in templates to rtrim() so that those with OCD can create pretty source code for their themes.</p>
<p>We're also looking to provide public access to our GitHub repositories in the very near future where a few problems have stopped us from doing so sooner. As soon as the MyBB 1.8 theme changes are ready we'll also be making that project available too - alongside development standards for non-team members for those who want to get involved in helping us create the best free forum software.</p>
<h4>Changes on the Team</h4>
<p>Many will have noticed some changes on the team recently. We've welcomed back on-board Polarbear541 to our SQA Team and StefanT and Nathan Malcolm have moved over from SQA to the Development Team. All have quickly jumped into their new roles and we're looking forward to their contributions.</p>
<h4>Joining the Team</h4>
<p>Being apart of the MyBB family and developing the future of forum software is no small task. Being volunteers takes dedication and patience as well as the skills to pull off your role. Take a look at <a title="Join the Team" href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply" target="_blank">Joining the Team</a>, and if you meet the descriptions, send us an application – we’d love to have you on the Team!</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>You've been hearing this for months, if not years by now: the new Mods site is coming soon.<br />
That was in fact, always true. However, the person who was working on it had to leave the team last year and left us his work.<br />
Since I offered myself to do the Mods site, I decided to start from scratch and create a plugin instead of a separate website - that would make integration much easier.<br />
I started back in October 2011 and by now the Mods site is almost fully operational - apart from the Plugin Translations feature and a few final touches, everything is done! It has been tested thoroughly by me and the rest of the team and even though it's not perfect, it does what we wanted to just fine.</p>
<p>Now let's get to what's really important: what's changed? how does it work? what's new?<br />
The entire Mods site is now based on a single word: collaboration.<br />
You will now be able to have people working on the same project as you, contributing to it, discussing it...in one single place.</p>
<p>Major features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Control Panel</li>
<li>Builds</li>
<li>Bug Tracker</li>
<li>Suggestions</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-project-page-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1911" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW PROJECT PAGE 2" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-project-page-2.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="90" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-project-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1906" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW PROJECT PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-project-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="87" /></a><br />
<strong>Collaboration</strong><br />
When you create a project (no matter what kind of project is - a plugin, graphic, whatever) you will be considered the author of that project.<br />
As the author, you can invite other people to become collaborators of your project and help you with it - being it as a tester, developer or anything else.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-manage-collaborators.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1909" title="SCREENSHOT OF MANAGE COLLABORATORS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-manage-collaborators.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Control Panel</strong><br />
The Control Panel is the place where you can view what's going on over the projects you work on and of course, manage invitations from other users.<br />
Another feature of the Control Panel is the one that lets you create a project (for obvious reasons, this is the most important one).<br />
When you create a project you are required to submit an initial build and that project will be set for "Awaiting Approval" unless you are considered an "Approved Developer".<br />
An "Approved Developer" is someone we think has gained enough confidence from us to believe that any project created by that person is safe for the end user.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-control-panel.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1905" title="SCREENSHOT OF CONTROL PANEL" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-control-panel.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="93" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Builds</strong><br />
Every project is now built around builds. That is, whenever you want to upload a new change you just submit a new build (a ZIP containing the latest data).<br />
That build is automatically considered "dev" and can be downloaded by anyone. When you think you've reached a stable status, you can switch (requires approval) to "stable".<br />
The latest stable build is the one that appears on the download page - don't worry, you can browse a list of builds and download any.<br />
Builds may only be submitted by the author and its collaborators.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-download-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1907" title="SCREENSHOT OF DOWNLOAD PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-download-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="83" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-manage-builds.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1908" title="SCREENSHOT OF MANAGE BUILDS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-manage-builds.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="109" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-all-builds.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1902" title="SCREENSHOT OF ALL BUILDS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-all-builds.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Bug Tracker</strong><br />
Is there a better way to have a stable project than having a bug tracker built-in with the new system? We thought one would be very important and decided to implement it.<br />
You can decide if it's private (author only) and if collaborators can access it or not or even give access to certain users who are not direct collaborators.<br />
If you don't agree with us and don't like bug trackers or have a bug tracker somewhere else, you can even link to that one if you wish and disable the default one.</p>
<p>The way the bug tracker works is similar to the way Redmine works so if you're used to work with Redmine you will not find strange to work with this one - but of course, don't expect it to be thaaaaaat powerful, I only have got two hands!</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-bug-tracker-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1903" title="SCREENSHOT OF BUG TRACKER #1" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-bug-tracker-1.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="105" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Suggestions</strong><br />
Receiving feedback from users is very important if you want to create amazing software. Because of that, we decided to implement a Suggestions page in which users can give suggestions for your project.<br />
If you don't like it, feel free to disable it, it's all up to you!</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-suggestions-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1910" title="SCREENSHOT OF SUGGESTIONS PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-suggestions-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="76" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-suggestion.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1901" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW SUGGESTION" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-suggestion.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="81" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong><br />
Besides those major features, the Mods site also contains a few others which make it even better:<br />
* Previews - you can now manage your project preview images in a much better way than before.<br />
* Translations – plugin projects are the only ones who have got translations and can be easily managed by collaborators – only they can submit translations.<br />
* Change Log - whenever you submit a new build, you are required to enter a change log. The change log of the project is the combination of every build's change log.<br />
* Recommended - we got rid of the project ratings. You can recommend projects but not give any rating.<br />
* Statistics - this page shows you relevant information about the most downloaded projects as well as the most recommended ones.<br />
* Mod CP - Projects and Builds can be easily managed from the Mod CP which speeds up the approval process.<br />
* Whenever an update is awaiting approval, users can still download the latest stable (or any other) build without problems.<br />
* If the project hasn't been updated for more than 6 months, you will see that information when viewing the project page.<br />
* Support - a new link has been added to the project page which links to the Plugin Support forum on the MyBB Community. However, project authors can change that link to their site's URL if they wish.<br />
* Optionally, users may enter their PayPal email address which will result in a Donate button being shown on the project page.</p>
<p>We hope you are still excited about it. We are too. We really want to push this live as soon as possible but as you know, we all do this on our free time. One thing is certain though: we want to release this at the same time as MyBB 1.8 (or perhaps sooner!).</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2012/07/12/mybb-1-8-tour-july-update/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">12 Jul 2012</span></a></p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Since we announced MyBB 1.8 back in April work towards making a public beta has been slow. This time of year is traditionally the busiest for the team members with exams, workloads and personal projects – not to the mention most of us enjoying the summer (or lack of, in some cases!) – often taking over from our usual MyBB duties. Where we were once working on the code every day there has been weeks without anything being done at all. This is, unfortunately, the perils of volunteer work.</p>
<p>We know you're all just as excited about MyBB 1.8 as we are, and we haven't told you everything that is changing yet, so we're stepping it up a gear to put it all together as fast as we can without compromising our new features. We've tried setting deadlines (and failing miserably) and I know you're sick of the usual ready-when-it's-ready story so all I can say is please bear with us. We'll be working hard to bring you this feature update and that starts with our move to GitHub.</p>
<h4>Git Migration</h4>
<p>Part of the fallout from when MyBB.com was partly taken over was to have an overview look at how we do things behind the scenes to see if we could improve our services. This understandably has a knock-on effect on our development; we decided it was best to drop SVN and move to GitHub ahead of the 1.8 schedule. MyBB 1.6 development also happens over there too.</p>
<p>We've briefly hidden the 1.6 repository so that our team can get used to this new service and for us to sort out some new standards for developers and contributors to follow. This is a pretty big change not only for users but for our team as well so we need to take some time to get used to it too.</p>
<p>That being said, we haven't quite got rid of everything. We will still be using the development site - powered by Redmine - as the central place to report bugs and issues with MyBB and the Merge System. It is up and running but we are having a few problems syncing the repository on GitHub and our local copy here. We hope to have this - and the GitHub project - up and running soon.</p>
<h4>Consistency in 1.8</h4>
<p>A general trait that has been hanging over 1.8 during planning and early development is consistency; making sure everything we do looks and feels the same as though it is from the same product, system and service. Everything from MyBB.com to the install process on your own forums will be getting a makeover to the new upgraded style giving MyBB in general a clean modern look. We've replaced the popular FamFamFam icons with the equally popular Fugue icon set to give 1.8's UX (user experience) a fresh appeal - meaning 1.8 uses CSS buttons and carries PNG icons instead of GIFs. We're looking into providing sprite images too for the ever-conscious large forum owner as well as providing theme artists a new opportunity with this style of coding.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1889" align="aligncenter" width="670"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/1800_update-21.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-1889   " title="1.8 Installer and Postbit" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/1800_update-21.png" alt="1.8 Installer and Postbit" width="670" height="254" /></a> 1.8 Installer and Postbit[/caption]</p>
<p>Alongside the jQuery update and base colours, 1.8 themes are sure to be some of the best in the series.</p>
<h4>Full Feature Update</h4>
<p>So, as you might have thought by now, MyBB 1.8 is going to be a bigger update than most people imagined. While not 2.0-esque, it will certainly provide a full feature update that will require careful planning and action. And, to settle the nerves of the plugin developers, there will be no major updates to the plugin system - meaning for the majority only the compatibility section of your plugins will need updated for them work in 1.8.</p>
<p>By providing an update like this we hope to extend the life of the 1.x series while also providing the tools and processes for developers to create even more amazing themes and plugins. It also gives us, as a team, a chance to rebalance our own structure to provide a better product for you all to enjoy.</p>

        <p>On April 1st we announced a 1.6.7 Update which updated both MyBB and the Merge System. If you haven't seen this or not upgraded yet please make sure you read the <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2012/04/01/mybb-1-6-7-update-1-8-development/" target="_blank">MyBB and Merge System 1.6.7 Release blog post</a>. We also announced our plans for MyBB 1.8; it was no April Fool.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, just under 2 years ago, we released MyBB 1.6 which introduced over 40 new features - some more at home in commercial software. As MyBB's popularity continues to grow, the rise of social networks, rival software and the greater expectations of users old and new gives us some of the hardest challenges we've faced; to stay on top, to deliver a brilliant product and provide it to you for free.</p>
<p>With our development roadmap for MyBB 2.0 getting underway soon, we quickly felt the need to bridge the large gap that would have been 1.6 to 2.0. We wanted to create something that would provide a legacy to users of the 1.x series - the best of the best - and there was only one way we could get that to our users; MyBB 1.8.</p>
<h3>What You Can Expect From 1.8</h3>
<p>Whereas 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 delivered over 100 new features 1.8 aims to be more of a subtle upgrade, a facelift and a move to more open source development so that others too can help create the best free forum software. We'll of course be providing the usual bug fixes and working with large forum owners to see if we can help further improve performance and stability. MyBB 1.8 is a perfect chance for us to provide changes that we couldn't typically do within our maintenance cycles.</p>
<h4>A New Look</h4>
<p>When we announced our new logo and mascot, Bolt, the Team soon realised that we didn't want to wait until 2.0 was released to use them. The 1.6 default theme made these look out of place in its dated design (which was last updated in 2008) so we needed something more up to date. Justin, our lead designer, who created the Apart theme series (from which many MyBB communities either use or have customised the look for themselves) has worked on developing the series for the new 1.8 default theme. We worked together to figure out a method for enabling the Apart colours to be included by default but without the need for including 14 separate themes before the administrator even opened their forum. This method is what we call <strong>attachable base colours</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/apart-1800-overview.png" target="_blank"><img class="teaser_illustration" title="The new default theme for MyBB 1.8" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/apart-1800-overview.png" alt="The new default theme for MyBB 1.8" width="670" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>These changes to the theme system allow you to create colours to which you can attach stylesheets (just like you can attach stylesheets to pages). You can also set a display order for all your stylesheets so that they can override styles. Together, the changes mean you can add a theme with as many custom colours as you want. Using the parent/child theme structure that already exists in 1.x you can restrict or allow certain usergroups to use these colours and, as they inherit the main stylesheets, they're very easy to manage. So, there is no longer the need to install a dozen different themes just for a different colour header.</p>
<h4>A New Look Admin Control Panel (ACP)</h4>
<p>Along with the new default theme there needs to be a new look Admin Control Panel (ACP). Our ACP is regarded as one of the easiest to use; it's friendly and we didn't want to change it much. Instead, we gave it a similar Apart makeover to our front-end.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/acp-1800-overview.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="teaser_illustration" title="Screenshot of the MyBB 1.8 ACP" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/acp-1800-overview.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the MyBB 1.8 ACP" width="670" height="379" /></a></p>
<p>Please note that along with the default theme the look may change as development continues.</p>
<h4>Powered by jQuery</h4>
<p>While 1.8 won't be able to make your cocoa or project your forum's logo onto the moon, much to our disappointment, we really weren't pulling a prank on this one; MyBB 1.8 will be powered by jQuery. The lighter and more powerful JavaScript library should be able to extend what both Theme Artists and Plugin Developers are able to do without causing conflicts or heavy loading pages. Both front-end and back-end will use the library. This change is probably the most destructive for themes and plugins in the 1.8 upgrade and we'll be providing support throughout its beta period ready for a main release. In total, including the changes to the default theme, about 20 templates require updating from 1.6.</p>
<p>Along with jQuery comes a change in post editor. Although I've had my eye on an 'off the shelf' editor for quite some time we've yet to make a decision on whether we write our own or not; we'll be covering that in a future tour. However, please don't suggest which editor to use as our aim is to make it interchangeable so you can use your favourite one.</p>
<h4>Trash Can</h4>
<p>One of the most requested features for MyBB is a trash can - or as I prefer, the ability to recover deleted posts. In 1.8, you'll be able to decide if a user's deleted post is obliterated forever or is recoverable via the Mod CP. Global and usergroup permissions will allow this to be controlled across your users.</p>
<h4>Spam Improvements</h4>
<p>For those of you waiting for Spam Ninja I'm very sorry to disappoint as I did promise it to you last year. As soon as 1.8 was decided, I stopped developing it as a plugin and started integrating relevant parts into the core instead. We'll be looking to improve spam prevention and detection in 1.8 which we'll cover in a future tour.</p>
<h4>Upgrading to 1.8</h4>
<p>Upgrading to 1.8 will be similar to upgrading from 1.4 to 1.6; many plugins will only need to change their compatibility line and will only need some major changes if they use Prototype JavaScript, use login functions or make large theme changes. Throughout the beta period, we'll be upgrading the Wiki with new information and providing support to plugin developers to help them with their new plugins.</p>
<h4>Github</h4>
<p>The Team has been trying to plan a move away from our current SVN setup to the popular social coding site Github for some time. We've come up against problems but feel confident that now is the time to open up our development to people outside of the MyBB Team. Github can be an extremely powerful tool for development and it is something we're eager to do - we have been working on 1.8 in secret in one of our repositories there which will be made available after our first beta release.</p>
<p>We've gone outside of our usual box with 1.8 in that we're actually telling you what we're doing and what we're planning even though none of this is public. We're aiming to provide a beta of 1.8 in May so please be patient while we're polishing our development and removing all the takeaways and soft drink cans.</p>
<h3>Wrap</h3>
<p>With MyBB 1.8, our aim is to fully complete the series with features and improvements that make us a better rival not only to our free forum software friends but also to commercial community software too. We want to make it more friendly, faster and go further than any of our products have been before. Everyone here at MyBB is looking forward to 1.8 and hope you are too!</p>
<p>See you at the next tour!</p>
<p>Tomm</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>After almost 8 years, MyBB has certainly come a long way. Its popularity among forum software is strong, and with the release of 1.6 almost a year ago it just keeps growing and growing. With its simplicity and extensions, there's really nothing you can't do with MyBB. Every member of the Team, past and present, are no doubt proud of where we are today.</p>
<p>However, we can't sit still in the ever moving world of forums and message boards. New software appears - it seems, every month - which people expect MyBB to better, and who are we to disappoint? It's time for us to develop the future.</p>
<h4>MyBB 1.6</h4>
<p>While there are no new 'features' expected for the 1.6 series of MyBB, we're still dedicated to maintaining it and making sure your forum (and business) is safe.</p>
<p>1.6.4 - where there are over 100 issues that have been fixed - is going to be available very soon. It fixes some (very) old issues dating back years including some obscure security issues. While none of these are 'high risk' issues or bugs, it's always a nice feeling knowing that your site is as stable as it can be. We aren't just stopping there though - this version is the first in a minor release to have 'feature updates'.</p>
<p>These feature updates are small improvements to MyBB - as apposed to feature releases which are big changes - and range from things like a setting to globally switch on/off all plugins to providing better access for Plugin Developers and Administrators to check for updates. These will be coming throughout the 1.6 series - and if they affect Plugin Developers or Theme Artists, we'll keep you informed before their release on the MyBB Community Forums.</p>
<h4>Spam Prevention</h4>
<p>This year, there has been somewhat of an explosion in the amount of human-cooked spam. More realistic than the robot kind, this spam can range from signature links to forums filled with posts in hours. While the best method is moderation - and reporting users who do spam - there's always going to be better methods and controls for protecting your forum and cleaning up after them. That's why we're working to produce Spam Ninja - a feature update for the 1.6 series that will introduce basic controls to help you eliminate spam and their robot|human chefs permanently.</p>
<p>The Spam Ninja update will be available later this year and will be completely optional if you use it or not. More information on the new features it introduces will be announced closer to the time.</p>
<p>Alongside maintaining 1.6 however, developing MyBB 2 is just as important.</p>
<h4>MyBB 2.0</h4>
<p>At MyBB, we tend to keep 2.0 secrets close - it's not that we don't want you to know! It's because as the development process moves on, coding and features are more than likely going to change so we don't want to promise things that might never materialize. Rest assured, while many may think that 2.0 is a mere myth, it does exist and we'll be walking through some of the boring stuff that won't be likely to change.</p>
<p>We've made no surprises that Justin - our Lead Designer - has created the awesome 2.0 default theme. It brings sweeping changes to the thread and forum layout that will make MyBB stand out from other software, and contrary to a popular thread on the Community, it definitely does not look like vBulletin. While the software still has that MyBB look and charm, it does mean that we've had the chance to reorganize various other areas - such as introducing conversation-style Private Messaging, a simplified User CP and Moderation Queues to make things much more modern, efficient and user friendly. As you would expect, it looks and feels like a state-of-the-art forum system.</p>
<p>While we won't be showing off the software just yet, we can still keep you in the loop.</p>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px;"><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/login_2-0-dev.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="inline_illustration" title="2.0 Login Page" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/login_2.0-dev-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="100" /></a></div>
<p>MyBB 2.0 has been written from scratch in a MVC (Model-View-Controller) method and we've been using <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com" target="_blank">Yii</a> as its base framework. Standing for "Yes It Is!", Yii is a powerful, very secure and fast framework and after a very long process, we found it to be the best choice for MyBB. Its database abstraction layers introduces various options (including PDO transactions and Active Record, Yii's Object Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques) and it provides some fantastically simple language and internationalization ideas. We've also used the <a href="http://www.twig-project.org/" target="_blank">Twig Template Engine</a> for views, increasing security and adding various possibilities of using PHP in templates. You can see an example (currently part of the 2.0 "login" page) of a Twig template and its output in the screenshot to the right.</p>
<p>For languages, we're embracing Yii's language translations. As an example, to translate a string in 2.0 you simply call like this:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;"><code>// Structure of the 'global' language file<br />
return array(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'mybb_welcome' =&gt; 'Welcome to MyBB {version}!',<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'language_string' =&gt; 'Another language string',<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'language_string_2' =&gt; "Yet another language string that's awesome."<br />
);</p>
<p>// An example of use in the software<br />
// Will display 'Welcome to MyBB {version}!'<br />
$foo = Yii::t('global', 'mybb_welcome');</p>
<p>// Will display 'Welcome to MyBB 2.0!'<br />
$foo = Yii::t('global', 'mybb_welcome', array('{version}' =&gt; Yii::app()-&gt;mybb-&gt;version));<br />
</code></div>
<p>You can call on whatever language file you want from anywhere in the software. Making a language pack is just as easy as it was in 1.6 too - if not easier!</p>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px;"><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/install_2-0-dev.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="inline_illustration" title="2.0 Installation" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/install_2.0-dev-180x100.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="100" /></a></div>
<p>Another area we're keen to improve on is MyBB's installer. The new version introduces a one-click install - you just simply enter all your details and the process practically completes itself. See the screenshot of the introduction page!</p>
<p>As you can tell, we have the basics of the software prepped and ready to start. It's no longer 'Planning', but what I would call 'Pre-Production' - where we concrete ideas, features and most importantly, a road map, are written. After working with 2.0, I can tell you that the future definitely is exciting. It's never tasted so good!</p>
<h4>Developing for MyBB</h4>
<p>Being apart of the MyBB family and developing the future of forum software is no small task. Being volunteers takes dedication and patience as well as the skills to pull off your role. Take a look at <a href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply">Joining the Team</a>, and if you meet the descriptions, send us an application - we'd love to have you on the Team!</p>

        <p>The MyBB Group is proud to release the first public beta of MyBB 1.6.  There are over <a title="MyBB 1.6 Feature List" href="http://dev.mybboard.net/projects/mybb/issues?query_id=1" target="_self">48 new features</a> some of which we have featured in two of our previous blog postings (sneak previews: <a title="MyBB 1.6 Sneak Preview Part 1" href="http://blog.mybboard.net/2010/01/01/mybb-16-sneak-preview-part-1/">part 1</a>, <a title="MyBB 1.6 Sneak Preview Part 2" href="http://blog.mybboard.net/2010/01/25/mybb-1-6-sneak-preview-part-2/">part 2</a>).  In addition, there are a number of improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>MyBB 1.6 aims to provide a number of fresh new features to the 1.4.x code base.  We had backward compatibility in mind, and so most themes and modifications designed for 1.4.x should work with 1.6 with minimal changes.</p>
<h4>Beta software</h4>
<p>As this is still beta software, we expect there are going to be bugs, anomalies and other related issues.  Please report any bugs in our <a title="MyBB Development Site" href="http://dev.mybboard.net/projects/mybb/issues">development tracker</a>, with all the information you may find relevant (error verbatim, reproduction procedure, server software, browser, etc), and please search before posting.  At this time we do not recommend running this on a production forum.  It is highly recommended that you create backups of your files and database before attempting to use MyBB 1.6.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>The support team will be providing limited official support for the beta software.  Our concentration for support will still be on our stable series, 1.4.x, so please be patient.  As usual, we can only provide support for assistance in using MyBB's features.  We cannot provide support for customizations including plugins, modifications, and themes.</p>
<h4>Download and further information</h4>
<p>The MyBB 1.6 Beta can be <a title="MyBB 1.6 Beta Download" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-69638.html" target="_self">downloaded here</a>.  Please read our <a title="MyBB 1.6 FAQ" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-69672.html">1.6 FAQ</a> as well.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>As part of our recent (and emergency) server migration, we've just finished restructuring our development server (that hosts the <a href="http://dev.mybboard.net/">MyBB Development Portal</a> and Subversion repositories). As a result, if you're checking out and working with our Subversion repositories, please be aware that the URLs for doing so have changed.</p>
<p>The new official Subversion repositories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyBB - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Merge System - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-import/</a></li>
<li>MyBB Modifications - <a href="http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/">http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb-modifications/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've already checked out a copy of MyBB using Subversion, you can switch your local copy to the new URL using the following command:<br />
<code>svn switch --relocate http://dev.mybboard.net/svn/mybb/ http://svn.mybboard.net/mybb</code></p>
<p><strong>Please note that the old Subversion URLs will continue to work for the majority of users the time being.</strong> However, if you're running Mac OS X, you'll need to switch to the new URLs due to a bug with the Subversion client that ships with Mac OS X.</p>
