        <p>I am pleased to announce that StefanT will soon be taking over from me as project manager.</p>
<p>MyBB has been an exciting 7 year journey for me and I've witnessed an enormous amount of progress during my time. The project is still of great significance to me, however I have recently been unable to dedicate the time it deserves, largely due to several great opportunities that have consumed most of my attention for the last two years. Therefore I have made the tough decision to retire from the project and hand over the reigns to someone fresh and motivated.</p>
<p>A ballot was conducted among the team members to decide my successor. Nominations were open to all team members and Stefan was the successful candidate. I am very confident that the project will be in safe hands under Stefan's leadership given the excellent job he has done steering development efforts over the past year.</p>
<p>I am also very excited to see what the future holds for MyBB. I hope my retirement will allow some of the newer team members to take greater ownership over the project and help take MyBB to new heights. In particular I'm pleased by the work towards 2.0 which has begun recently and I hope the team will be able to share more about that with you soon.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank the community for their support of the project, and the team who I have greatly enjoyed collaborating with over the years.</p>
<p>Regards, Tim B.</p>

        <p>With the release of MyBB 1.6.13, the team felt there was a need to address some issues that affect the future of the Project, the Community and the Team in general.</p>
<h4>Developers and MyBB Development Workflow</h4>
<p>With the departure of Nathan and Tomm, MyBB has once again found itself in need of active team members. This, along with the unavailability of most current developers due to time constraints caused by life issues, led to us breaking our workflow, which as you may have noticed ended up delaying the release of MyBB 1.6.13. After MyBB 1.6.13 was out, work on 1.8 Beta 1 has been resumed (and you can clearly see that by examining the commits made for on github in the 'feature' branch).</p>
<h4><strong>Moving forward with 2.0.</strong></h4>
<p>Initially 1.6 was supposed to lead to 2.0 directly, but with the team feeling that 2.0 was still in very early development, MyBB would lose to its competitors for quite a bit of time (the development time of 2.0). Thus, work was put into "modernizing" the look and feel of 1.6 before the complete rewrite, and so 1.8 was born. As anticipated, this has delayed work on 2.0 of course. Once 1.8 is released (Beta 1 is nearing its completion; at time of writing only one feature is left to finish: jQuery conversion; all the other open issues aimed for Beta 1 are bugs) work will start on 2.0. There has been a lot of talk of MyBB being a "<em>dead project"</em>, but this is very far from the truth. As an open source project, as long as we have active developers, the project will never be "<em>dead".</em> But we need the community's help - we've been helping you for a long time, we're asking you to help us now  - so if you feel that you know MyBB pretty well but most of all, if you feel that you have value to give to the team and project, contact us!</p>
<h4><strong>Changes that we are implementing now</strong></h4>
<p>It became apparent to us, that one of the major problems we have had was losing key team leaders. As you may remember, we recently <em>got rid of </em>the "Team Leader" role, and went with a more equal structure. This did not promote (as we had intended) productivity. So we have come up with a new system, whereby developers will take turns taking the "<em>lead" </em>on a per version basis. This will keep them all updated with the procedures required to package and release new versions. We are pleased to announce the <strong><a title="Stefan T. - I shall grant thee 1.6.14" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-2824.html" target="_blank">Stefan T</a></strong> will be assuming the role of Lead Developer first and and the next should be <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8582.html">Pirata Nervo</a> (after that a new internal poll will be made). We are also pleased to announce that <strong><a title="King Louis - King of SQA" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-57502.html" target="_blank">King Louis</a></strong> will be assuming the position of SQA team lead (the leader here doesn't change as we believe the SQA team requires a static leader).</p>
<h4><strong>Recruitment</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, we are now looking for more active members for both Development, Support, and more importantly SQA (we're running low here!).  If you feel that you would be a good addition to the team, why not submit some pull requests on Github and/or drop an application to using the <strong><a title="Contact form" href="http://www.mybb.com/contact?subject=team-position" target="_blank">contact form</a>, </strong>posting a thread in <strong><a title="Post a thread in this forum that only YOU and US can see..." href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html" target="_blank">Private Inquiries</a> (recommended) </strong>or even by <em>PM'ing </em><a title="If I don't respond within 24 hours I will owe you a cookie." href="http://community.mybb.com/private.php?action=send&amp;uid=12694" target="_blank"><strong>us</strong></a>.  You cand read more about the responsibilities <strong><a title="Apply for the Team" href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply" target="_blank">here</a>. Do not be afraid of contacting us, we won't bite you - but we'll be always be honest with you.<br />

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2014/03/05/a-farewell-to-tom-moore/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">05 Mar 2014</span></a></p>
    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>It's with great sadness that I have to announce Tom Moore (<a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-14621.html" target="_blank">Tomm M</a> on the community forums) has decided to depart from the MyBB Team.</p>
<p>Since joining the dev team in 2009, Tom has been at the forefront of MyBB development, even more so after <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2010/12/05/ryan-gordons-departure-from-mybb/" target="_blank">the departure of Ryan Gordon</a>. Having led the 1.6 series throughout its life, fixing countless bugs and issues, and putting his ideas and talent in to 1.8, MyBB today lies upon Tom's vision and hard work. His dedication and will has been undeniable and we wish him the best for the future, and with whatever comes next.</p>
<h4>What does this mean for MyBB?</h4>
<p>While it's sad to see such a talented developer leave the team, it's often something which is expected with open source software. We believe that even though we no longer have Tom, there will always be developers out there willing to carry on his vision and continue to bring MyBB to the people. We're very excited to see what comes next for MyBB, and we hope you are too.</p>
<h4>A message from Tom to all…</h4>
<blockquote><p>To all at MyBB,</p>
<p>It's with a heavy heart that I'll be departing from the MyBB Team who, in every respect, has been more of a family over the last 5 years. We've fought, argued and definitely fallen out more than a few times but a single aim has always been at the front of thinking for every team member (past and present): to create the best free forum software for your community.</p>
<p>This niche software industry, which many thought would be swallowed by social networks, is thriving with seemingly new competitors every week. Each with their own gimmick, of course. But they often fail where MyBB succeeds due to 3 basic principles that haven't changed in its 10 year history: extensibility, ease of use and functionality.</p>
<p>It's inevitable that MyBB must change for the modern user, and you shouldn't fear this, as by following these principles and focusing on putting great content at the heart of the software can only mean another great product from one of the most talented teams I've had the privilege to be a part of. The future of this forum software is exciting and I can't wait for everyone to (eventually!) use it.</p>
<p>I wish you and your communities the very best of luck.</p>
<p>- Tomm</p></blockquote>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Every so often developments, changes, discussions and events occur that make even the most resilient users, team members and followers lose interest in our project. We, as a group, can only apologise for the miscommunication and missed chances to set things right.</p>
<p>We realise that with every step you take we need to be right beside you and not in the shadows pulling the strings. We need to learn from how you use our software, embrace the unique customisation of your forum and make it as easy as possible for you to see what we’re planning - and how you can help us accomplish that.</p>
<p>We understand that we need to be more open; this week, we’re taking the first steps to do that.</p>
<h4>Team Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>There will be one ‘MyBB Team’ usergroup to which all team members will belong to.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">This change is mainly for our internal processes only as there are a number of shared tasks and responsibilities across the group. Each member still belongs to a sub-group, such as Support or SQA, to which they’ll focus the bulk of their time. The member’s team will be visible by their usergroup badge and not username colour.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>There will be no application process or job vacancies for team member positions.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">Being more open will allow users and followers to discuss changes, make commits and write documentation without being a member of the team. We encourage anyone and everyone to help in all aspects of the project and, if they accept, can be invited to join the team for a more permanent group position and a pretty usergroup badge.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Members of the MyBB Team should be considered core workers who regularly contribute to the project.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">With open development forums we’ll be relying more on user contributions and interactions to move the project forward. The team will be there to help and guide you through the hoops whether you’re a beginner or an expert.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Forum Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’re reorganising Support forums to help provide the quickest service possible.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">A new Installation and Upgrade Support forum is being created to help users who are struggling to get their forum going. General Support, Security Management and Support, Merge System Support and International Support will also be a part of this category.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re moving International Support to 3rd party sites for users to get help in their native language.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">MyBB has a large non-English following and we struggle to support these users. By providing easy access to the best support forum in their native language they’ll benefit from their local community. International Support will be closed to posting and have only one thread per language – which will include language pack addons for the language and a list of support forums available.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re making an official repository for language packs.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">The mybb-translations repository on GitHub will hold all official language pack addons for MyBB and we hope translators will move to this model. They’ll be able to get support from other members of their community to help translate MyBB into their language. Greater communication with translators will help have packs ready for new releases.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re centralising the Resources forums to provide a one-stop place for modifications.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">The Resources section on our forum will change to include Plugins, Themes, Translations, Third Party Integrations, MyCodes and Tutorials. Sub-forums in these categories will provide Releases, Support, Development and Requests threads.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re removing the Requests/Services/Jobs forum.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">This area has been a near constant thorn for team members and moderation and, by redirecting users to the Resources forums (for plugins/themes/logos) or Web Development forum (for domains and general help), we’ll have more time to concentrate on our project.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Being a part of the MyBB Team is a privilege, not a hindrance.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">
<p>While we actively promote user contributions we expect all members of the community to rightfully respect team members, who are dedicating their time to help.</p>
<p>Personal attacks, trolling and disrespect is not acceptable anywhere; whether on a forum or workplace; and it will not be tolerated. Past history and rules have cultured a group whose sole intention is to disrupt, disengage and challenge and this has to change.</p>
<p>We feel those who are responsible for this change know who they are. We want the MyBB community to be friendly, mature, creative and open. If users of the community can’t do this new forum permissions can restrict them from certain areas and, ultimately, a permanent ban will be issued.</p>
<p>No users, regardless of length of membership, status in the community or reputation, are immune to this.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Development</h4>
<ul>
<li>There will be new development forums for MyBB 1.6, MyBB 1.8 and MyBB 2.0. These include Discussion, Bugs and Issues, and Suggestions and Feedback.</li>
<li>While these will be available for everyone only members of the new Contributors group will be able to post in the Discussion forum. This usergroup can be joined via your User CP and is exclusively for people who contribute to the project (via making resources, tutorials, guides etc. or interacting on GitHub).</li>
<li>We’ll be turning off new issues on Redmine, our development site, and moving bug reporting to the forums. Once confirmed these bugs will be reported automatically on GitHub by a team member. While we would prefer users to follow this to be able to discuss bugs and reproduction, we won’t reject issues posted directly on GitHub if you prefer that method.</li>
<li>We’ll be moving to a GitFlow workflow for our main repository.</li>
<li>We'll be running scheduled releases so that you can expect regular updates for your forum (this won't affect security releases).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>These changes are all about cleaning up, refreshing and changing the way the MyBB project works to focus on our primary aim – to make great forum software – and for others to help us do that.</p>
<p>We’ll be making most of these changes this Friday, 1st November. Development changes will happen at a later date and more information will be available soon.</p>
<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
<p>The prospect of a Q&amp;A has been openly suggested quite a few times and I’m pleased to say that, alongside these changes, several team members and I will be available this weekend to take your questions. Look out for a thread in the Community and on Twitter for more details of this.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
<p>MyBB Team</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-81.html">Dennis Tsang</a> has been with the team for a long time, playing numerous important roles and having a lot of input over the years. He took some time to answer your questions!</p>
<h4>Being one of the more active, long-time members, what keeps you coming back to MyBB?</h4>
<p>MyBB is so easy to work with.  The core is easy to understand and use; it’s lean and lightweight.  It’s simple to customize.  In terms of the community, it’s the perfect size where people can get to know each other and help each other out.  There are wonderful developers and themers who produce awesome themes.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>I volunteer with a couple of youth groups, namely youth ministry at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Vancouver, B.C.  I am on the council of the S.U.C.C.E.S.S. Youth Leadership Millennium Program.</p>
<p>I am a transit enthusiast and photographer.  I love buses and trains.  My transit photography can be found at <a href="http://bustrainferry.com">BusTrainFerry.com</a>.</p>
<h4>What is it about public transport that you're so interested in?</h4>
<p>I’m most interested in the systems behind public transit operations.  For example, here in Vancouver we have a metro line called the SkyTrain, which is fully automated.  The automation has intrigued me since I was young and I’ve been trying to figure out how it all works.  The vehicles themselves (both buses and trains) are also an interest of mine -- the skill required by operators to maneuver the buses through traffic is astounding.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite movie?</h4>
<p>The Matrix.</p>
<h4>Are you as excited about MyBB as you first were about it?</h4>
<p>Yes of course.  The advent of MyBB 2.0 is very exciting as it’s the first rewrite we’ve done since the inception of the project itself.  The web has changed very dramatically in the past few years from both technical and social standpoints.  MyBB 2.0 will hopefully take forum software to the next level by harnessing new concepts and technologies and making a usable package in the age of Web 2.0 and beyond, while still maintaining our core roots of powerfulness, simplicity, and extensibility.</p>
<h4>What career do you hope to achieve after completion of your course?</h4>
<p>Later this year I will be starting as a software developer at <a href="http://www.athinkingape.com">A Thinking Ape</a>.  Software has always been an interest of mine, and that’s why I went into Computer Science.  My particular interests are in mobile and web technologies.</p>
<h4>The best day of your life was...</h4>
<p>The day I was born.</p>
<h4>In your opinion, what is the most underused feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>Threaded Mode on the show thread page.  I’ve never used it.  Do you use it?</p>
<h4>How long can you hold your breath for?</h4>
<p>At least the length of the George Massey Tunnel.</p>
<h4>Anything else you'd like to add?</h4>
<p>It’s been a pleasure to be on the MyBB team.  It’s always enjoyable to see people who use our software and love MyBB as much as we as staff do.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Get your questions answered</h4>
<p>They can be general to all/any staff or specific to one member, either way, post them in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-48501.html">Questions for team members</a> thread and I'll ask them if appropriate. A lot of staff have been answering questions in the thread too, so it's a great 'open discussion' thread too! Thank you.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>It's been a while since we've had an interview post, so let's kick things off again with a big one!<br />
Our new product manager, <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8198.html">Tim B.</a> took time to answer some questions.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>Well, I’m an Aussie to begin with, I’m a Software Engineering and Business student at university and I work from home.</p>
<h4>Besides MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>When I’m not at my computer (which is very rarely <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt=":P" />), I like to be on my Yamaha dirt bike, or my mountain bike (but I’m usually too lazy for that these days). Some strange hobbies also tend to gain my interest for a short period of time, for example lock picking (my own locks, don’t worry) and petrol powered remote control cars.</p>
<h4>What made you join the MyBB staff team?</h4>
<p>I had been a member here for quite a while before I joined the team so I had a bit of an attachment to MyBB. When a team member mentioned to me that they were looking for people to join the support team I decided that it was something I wanted to pursue because I felt it would allow my contributions to be more far reaching than I could achieve as a regular member. Upon joining I found that I enjoyed making long lasting improvements to the things that often get thrown in the too hard basket, but were nonetheless important, and so I made a number of suggestions that were adopted (and some that weren’t). I then took on a number of initiatives to improve sections of the wiki and the forum rules and soon after this Dennis announced that he had to step down due to time constraints. As I was doing a lot more behind the scenes stuff at that stage then actual support work I decided to put my name forward and eventually I was chosen to take over from Dennis, an opportunity which I am very grateful for.</p>
<h4>The most memorable day of my life was...</h4>
<p>Yesterday (I would say today, but it’s not over yet).</p>
<h4>What is your dream job?</h4>
<p>No job, I would be retired with a considerable fortune. <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt=":P" /> That way I could pursue whatever interest I desired. On a more realistic note, I hope to one day work in the management side of the software development industry, hence why I study business along with Software Engineering.</p>
<h4>What do you do to kill time?</h4>
<p>I am a master of wasting time. Sometimes that is a good thing, but unfortunately usually it’s not. <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt=":P" /> I have so many favourite time killers, facebook is an obvious one (but who doesn’t love to waste time on facebook these days), another one is a website called Moonbuggy which has random (and hilarious) pictures (if you go googling for it then be warned, it’s often NSFW). I enjoy some really simplistic games, like line rider and various other flash games, plus I occasionally get into Call of Duty and Minecraft. In terms of TV, I almost exclusively watch sitcoms, I have seen every episode of the The Office, The Big Bang Theory, Community, Parks and Recreation, Better Off Ted, 30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother, Modern Family, Outsourced, The IT Crowd, Seinfeld and Trailer Park Boys, plus a few others I probably forgot. I also have to mention that I love buying (pretty random) things off the internet, usually from Deal Extreme or eBay. For example, I have one of those clothes folders that Sheldon has in The Big Bang Theory. <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt=":P" /></p>
<h4>Name an item you wish to own one day, and why.</h4>
<p>A yellow Lamborghini Gallardo with black GT stripes, just because I’m cool like that. <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt=":P" /> If you had have asked me a few weeks ago I would have said my new computer but I just bought that. <img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/biggrin.gif" alt=":D" /></p>
<h4>What made you initially want to learn PHP/MySQL?</h4>
<p>I enjoy programming, it not only stimulates your mind but it produces something that can improve the lives of millions of people across the world and I think that’s pretty amazing. I never specifically made the choice to learn PHP/MySQL but through my involvement with MyBB and other things I have been a part of, learning PHP/MySQL became a necessity. I am certainly still learning, but I think that is the way for any programmer, looking back at my programming from a year ago I was a total n00b, and I'm sure I’ll think the same in another year about my programming now.</p>
<h4>What do you have for breakfast each day?</h4>
<p>I just eat whatever is in the fridge/pantry (left over pizza, pancakes or waffles always go down well). One of my favourite breakfast combos is Vanilla (or Chocolate) Up &amp; Go on Weet-Bix (if you’re not Australian you probably won’t have heard of either of those two things), it sounds a bit strange but it’s awesome, trust me.</p>
<h4>Anything else you wish to add?</h4>
<p>I don’t think so, other than that I would like to say thanks to the team for making MyBB possible and to the community for making MyBB as successful as it is.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Get your questions answered</h4>
<p>I'm always struggling to think of new and interesting questions, so please help me out and post what you would like answered! They can be general to all/any staff or specific to one member, either way, post them in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-48501.html">Questions for team members</a> thread and I'll ask them if appropriate. Thank you.</p>

        <p>Hello MyBB fans!<br />
So it's been a while since the last "Staff changes" blog post! We've had quite a few changes recently and thought it would be a perfect time to give you all an update on our great team.</p>
<h4>Welcome our new staff members</h4>
<p>Please welcome <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-16693.html">Fábio Maia</a> to the support team, more commonly known as faviouz to us all. faviouz has been a very helpful member on the community forums and has released several plugins and tutorials.<br />
Also welcome <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8582.html">Pirata Nervo</a> to the development team! Pirata has been an extremely helpful member and has also developed many great plugins.</p>
<h4>Thank staff who have moved on</h4>
<p>Our long-time contributor <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-14.html">Alan Crisp</a> has left after many years on the team. A while ago he took a job as a PHP developer with skills that he learned while on the team. This very job is what has led to him resigning from the team, with little free time to continue contributing. He thanks us for all the opportunities he was given here, and we thank him for his efforts, sincerely.<br />
We're also sad to see <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-24127.html">Conor Calby</a> leave, after a very helpful year on the team he has left due to time constraints as well. We hope he finds the time in the future to return.<br />
Unfortunately one of our more recent additions to the team, <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-34795.html">thebod</a>, also had to leave due to other commitments.</p>
<p>We are very thankful to anyone offering their time to MyBB and we wish those who left the very best of luck.</p>
<h4>Applications are always open</h4>
<p>If you would like to be a part of one of the teams we have here at MyBB (development, support, SQA), please take a look at <a href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply">this page</a> for more information.</p>

        <p>We are pleased to announce that MyBB has decided to develop an official mascot which will be used for a variety of purposes including promoting MyBB and on possible official MyBB merchandise.</p>
<p>As a result, the MyBB Group is in search for a great creative artist "doodler" who can help sketch and design the MyBB Mascot. The artist must have the creative ability to not only sketch the mascot, but be able to make a high resolution digital copy of the sketch(s). The artist must have the ability to work with a team and have the time to bring the MyBB Mascot to life. In addition, the artist must be willing to assign all copyright for their work to the MyBB Group.</p>
<p>Although this is a volunteer position and will not be a  permanent position on the team, their are benefits to joining:</p>
<ul>
<li>The artist will gain access to a specific private forum on the MyBB Community</li>
<li>The artist will receive an official team badge</li>
<li>The artist will receive due credit on the MyBB Wiki pertaining to the mascot created</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think you might be the one to fulfill this position, or if you have an inquiry regarding the position,  do get in touch at the following email address: <em>imad.jomaa@mybb.com</em>. Be sure to provide some samples of your work, both sketches and digital copies of the sketches. In addition, be sure to provide some background information about yourself, and any other information you feel necessary to share.</p>
<p>If you do not receive a direct response from the MyBB Group it doesn't mean we haven't received your application, rather, because we receive many applications, we cannot reply to each one individually. Applications sent in the form of private messages on the community forum will not be evaluated or considered.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and best of luck for those that apply.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>All,</p>
<p>As a few have noticed, Ryan Gordon, the lead developer of MyBB has parted ways with us. A message from Ryan is below.</p>
<p>All of us here at the MyBB Group wish Ryan well in his future endeavours, and I personally am extremely grateful for the role that Ryan has been able to step up and fulfil over the past few years whilst I've not been able to dedicate much personal time toward the project. Ryan's dedication and passion for everything he did, as well as bringing us some of the greatest MyBB releases to date, will be missed.</p>
<h4>What does this mean for MyBB?</h4>
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is whilst this is a big change for us, you can still look forward to exceptional releases of your favourite forum software. Work is underway planning out MyBB 2.0, and from our top-secret prototypes, it's already looking great.</p>
<p>We'll have more to announce shortly, but again thank you for your continued support.</p>
<h4>A message from Ryan to all...</h4>
<blockquote><p>Dear community,</p>
<p>It is with time that with every profession, interest and passion fade and something new comes along to take over it's place. It is with this in mind, among other things, that I have decided to enlist my resignation from the MyBB Team.</p>
<p>Over the past 5 years I've had the unique experience of journying with this team and working on this product that has taught me so much. Together we have built hundreds of thousands of communities and I know that this will continue for a long time into the future.</p>
<p>I wish the MyBB team and the community best of luck in the future, as I open up this new chapter in my life.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ryan Gordon</p></blockquote>

        <p>There has been a great deal of curiosity about the recent additions to the MyBB family so finally I am proud to formally introduce all our new developers to you.</p>
<h4>Ryon H</h4>
<p>Ryon is an enthusiastic PHP developer with a unique sense of humor. He also happens to speak several languages and apparently lives in a town between a tree and a rock (those are his words). We are also very glad his parents decided to name him Ryon rather than Ryan because that saves us a lot of confusion.</p>
<h4>Morgoth</h4>
<p>Update: Unfortunately Morgoth has had to leave us already due to some unforeseen issues. We wish him the best of luck with his future.</p>
<p>Morgoth (also known as -Calypso-) is an experienced PHP developer and has come to us from the IPB community where he was well known for developing a number of highly successful plugins.</p>
<h4>Sacred</h4>
<p>Sacred has also come to us from the IPB community and also has many brilliant plugins to his name. By day he is a Digital Media Manager for a leading online advertising agency and specializes in SEO and e-commerce as well as PHP development.</p>
<h4>Dylan M.</h4>
<p>Dylan has extensive programming experience and prior to joining the team was well known for his work with extending the MyBB merge system. We are very glad to have him aboard the team as the lead developer for the merge system.</p>
<p>So, please make all our new developers feel welcome and if you see them looking lost and dazed out on the forums don't hesitate to lend them a hand ;).</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-6928.html">Imad Jomaa</a> has answered in some detail a few questions.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>As you might have guessed, my name is Imad Jomaa; I happened to be one boring college Student studying to obtain a B.S. degree in Computer Science as well as a degree in Mathematics. I have been working on a start-up Company for two years now with two other partners, hoping we open our doors sometime soon.</p>
<h4>What does your dream job look like?</h4>
<p>I am hoping one of my ideas end up going somewhere. However, to be realistic here, I would love to end up working for a Company who love to innovate and share ideas, and possibly have a catchy mission statement. :P The other side of me wants to work for an organization aiming for global change in education as I believe education is a key factor in anyone's life. Furthermore, whichever of the two directions I end up in, you can call it “my dream job”.</p>
<h4>In your opinion, what is the most useful and simple feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>This is a tough decision since I have recently been using many features in MyBB I thought I would never use. However, to correlate with "most useful", I have to say it is the mark as read feature used on forum icons. I use that feature whenever I am on the forums and it saves a lot of time from entering each individual forum to perform such task.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Despite programming, I love the great outdoors where I am always mesmerized by the vast lands of beauty. I also enjoy expanding my knowledge in wide varieties of subjects ranging from chemistry to biology to marketing and pretty much anything else I find interesting.</p>
<h4>Your favourite piece of hardware/software is... Why?</h4>
<p>I am not necessarily sure if I happened to favor a specific piece of hardware or software over others as each of such have different functions and purposes. However, if we were to compare apples with apples in relation to operating systems I would use for conventional purposes, I would definitely say Microsoft’s Windows since it seems like a complete functional package over others. However, if I happened to be after a great GUI, I would definitely use OSX by Apple since it seems to have that aspect well laid out.</p>
<h4>What are some of your pet hates?</h4>
<p>This is another tough question to answer, but I would say the usage of foul language. The usage of such language seems ever increasing especially with young children. It seems as if it became an ongoing trend whether they understand it or not, or whether it is appropriate or not; thus it definitely annoys me.</p>
<h4>Is there a feature you've come up with (or seen elsewhere) that you would like to see implemented into MyBB one day? What is it and why would it be good for MyBB?</h4>
<p>One of the interesting projects I have seen for security CAPTCHA is dragging and dropping objects. I found it very intuitive to have your potential users be able to bypass the sometimes-unreadable characters to something simple and easy to use. The whole idea behind it is asking your user to drag a certain shape from a pool of them to the right – it is simple, intuitive and depending on how it is developed, secure from today’s and possibly future bots.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite TV series?</h4>
<p>I definitely say it has to be the Mythbusters TV series since they put popular myths to the test and in the end, finally clear up some unanswered questions in an entertaining form.</p>
<h4>What do you enjoy most about your life?</h4>
<p>I think it has to be the motivation in me that always wants me to expand my knowledge into many categories which gives me a better understanding of many aspects of today’s world.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>None at all, I think the nine questions asked covered everything I wanted to mention. :)</p>

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2010/10/09/new-recruiting-initiative/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">09 Oct 2010</span></a></p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p><strong>We are pleased to announce some new initiatives that will be rolled out over the coming weeks to help in our search for valuable new additions to our team.</strong></p>
<p>The quality of MyBB is largely dictated by the quality of our staff and as we look towards development of MyBB 2.0 we hope that these new recruitment strategies will help ensure the longevity and quality of MyBB in the future.</p>
<p>The main changes to our recruitment process is that we will be extending our search to outside our community and formalizing the process, making our selection process similar to applying for a regular job. As a result we will be actively advertising the positions available but also more stringent in our selection criteria.</p>
<p>We are primarily looking to fill development positions and we are looking for people will make a long term commitment to MyBB and hopefully become an integral part of the MyBB team in the future.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:normal;"><strong>We are looking for the types of people who:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are  true industry professionals</li>
<li>Have extensive and consolidated skills in PHP &amp; SQL</li>
<li>Are familiar with modern object oriented program design</li>
<li>Understand security and how important it is</li>
<li>Already have proven experience in the field</li>
<li>Believe in the open source software model</li>
</ul>
<p>Although developers are the focus of our search we will are also open to suitable applicants for other positions.</p>
<h3>Below are some of our initiatives:</h3>
<h4><span style="font-weight:normal;">Setting up the MyBB.com/apply page</span></h4>
<p>We have set up a page specifically for recruitment at <a href="http://www.MyBB.com/apply" target="_blank">http://www.MyBB.com/apply</a> which will act as a gateway for anyone interested in a position here. It has information on the roles we have available and what we expect in our applicants.</p>
<h4>Notice board flyer:</h4>
<p>If you attend a tertiary education institution such as University then there will probably be a lot of notice boards around for community notices. We have prepared a simple flyer which your welcome to print and put up on Computer Science/IT department noticeboards at your University. You can find the flyer <a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/flyer.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Off-site advertising:</h4>
<p>We will be identifying a number of websites and communities which are frequented by the kind of people we wish to recruit and have a section suitable for job advertisements. We will then be submitting articles to these sites outlining our organization and the positions we have available. Hopefully this will enable us to reach a broader group of quality developers who might be interested in a position here.</p>
<h3>Ensuring the integrity of our team:</h3>
<p>We realize many of our community members will be concerned that by recruiting outside our community we will be less familiar with our applicants and therefore there is the possibility of accepting someone who will be untrustworthy and detrimental to our product. We have recognized this and have implemented a number of new policies internally including an initial probation period and a revised permission hierarchy that will restrict the access of new staff to critical aspects of our project. As stated earlier we will also be more stringent in our selection process and ensure that only applicants of the highest integrity will be accepted.</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>Even if a position on the MyBB team isn't for you then you can still help by spreading the word of MyBB to people you know who might be suitable for one of our positions. You can also put up flyers as described above.</p>

        <p>One of our newest additions to the team, <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-23291.html">Huji Lee</a> answered the next batch of questions. PS. Please welcome Huji. :)</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm 27 (which probably makes the grandfather of the whole MyBB team), and I live in the United States. I'm a self-taught web developer with focus on Web 2.0 solutions developed using PHP and MySQL.</p>
<h4>Besides MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Who said MyBB is a hobby?! Anyways, I used to play different musical instruments and listen to music a lot.</p>
<h4>Who inspires you?</h4>
<p>I'm not much an "inspiration" guy. In other words, everybody is an inspiration to me.</p>
<h4>How long does it take you to fix the average bug with MyBB?</h4>
<p>A few minutes.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite type of music?</h4>
<p>I listen to many kinds of music and I always want to keep myself open to new genres. You can find me listening to Bach, Metallica, Naruto (Japanese), Don Omar (Puerto Rican Reggaetón) and Lionel Richie in the same day!</p>
<h4>Name an item that you one day wish to own.</h4>
<p>If you asked this 15 years ago, my answer would definitely be a model helicopter! Right now, I'm thinking of an iPhone instead! ;)</p>
<h4>If you didn't discover MyBB, what do you think you'd be doing with your free time instead?</h4>
<p>Coding for one of the other projects I dedicated my time to.</p>
<h4>What program do you use to code in?</h4>
<p>Notepad++ as my editor, an old version of Aqua Data Studio for some DB manipulations.</p>
<h4>Which type of weather do you prefer?</h4>
<p>I like it when the weather is cool.</p>
<h4>How does it feel knowing that software you've played a part in is being used by people all around the world?</h4>
<p>It brings excitement and responsibility.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>Some people ask me how is it that you only had less than 50 posts in the Community forums and you end up in the Developers team. I benefited from a MyBB based forum about a real issue in my life so I felt I owe MyBB team for making that possible; I talked to the lead developer Ryan Gordon and he figured I might be of assistance. If anybody who reads this also feels like he owes MyBB a favor, I think they should step forward too.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-27.html" target="_blank">Tom Huls</a>, a true MyBB veteran, answers your interview questions.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>My name is Tom, as you might have guessed from the <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-27.html" target="_blank">cute avatar</a> I have been using for quite some time now. I'm 22 years old, from the Netherlands and a fifth year maths student. My MyBB experience started when I began using <a href="http://www.msgpluslive.net/">Messenger Plus!</a>, which I must have been sixteen or something back then. For some reason I felt the need to post on the <a href="http://www.msghelp.net/">forum</a> there, which was powered by a very early version of MyBB. After some time I made some comments about the bulletin board software and that's how I ended up here.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>This question gets asked regularly by other people and usually I reply by saying that I enjoy reading and walking. However, the number of unread books on my shelf keeps growing and I hardly get out. That's mostly because studying takes up quite a bit of my time, but I intend to shift the balance a bit in the next few months. In any case, solving maths riddles is not on the list ;-)</p>
<h4>Being one of the more reserved MyBB team members, what are some of your duties regarding MyBB?</h4>
<p>Basically, I am in charge of all that relates to internationalization and managing the translations. That includes uploading new translations when they're finished, assisting translators in their joband also keeping the Dutch translation up-to-date, which I'm the author of. Apart from that, I do some basic stuff as changing usernames and giving support, although unfortunately I often find myself short of time so I have not been as active as I would like to be. In addition, I've helped beta test quite a few releases.</p>
<h4>What are your three favourite MyBB features, and briefly, why?</h4>
<p>- The search functionality, because although I tend to know fairly well that something was posted I can almost never find it again by simply looking for the thread in a specific forum.<br />
- The edit button. It's surprising to see how often I find myself using it, even though I'm also a great fan of the Preview button.<br />
- Multiple PM recipients. Makes sending the same personal message to multiple staff members or translators just that tad bit easier.</p>
<h4>What does your average day look like?</h4>
<p>I always try to get up at 6 am. I wash up, quickly grab some bread and cycle to the nearest train station. The train leaves at 6.45 and after a quick transfer I arrive at university at 8.05. During the trip I often read some of the free newspapers distributed at train stations, listen to some music or podcast, skip through some math books or just enjoy the view. As there's always something to do I rarely ever find myself bored or annoyed by the time it takes me to get to university. The day then consists mainly of studying, either on my own or by attending lectures. A bit after 5 pm I return home, where I eat, quickly turn my laptop on and deal with new emails, forum posts and so on. Then I take a shower at about 9.30 and go to bed quickly after that to get my eight hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Of course, in reality, I hardly ever manage to get up at six in the morning, trains are delayed, at university I get distracted by other students so don't get much done and in the evening I go to bed way too late to get my eight hours of sleep :P</p>
<p>Many weekends are spent with my girlfriend, family visits or watching Formula 1 and snooker.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>I wish to become a mathematics teacher. Indeed, not very spectacular ;-)</p>
<h4>What is your favorite movie?</h4>
<p>I can't say I have a favorite movie. One of the more recent movies I saw was "La tourneuse de pages", which I found a very nice one. One that also stuck was Elephant; not so much a nice movie, but certainly moving.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-14621.html">Tom Moore</a> tells us everything we've wanted to know, and more!</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm Tom and I'm from Carlisle, Cumbria, in England. And yes, it rains almost every day(!). I'm a Marketing Designer and Systems Developer and I'm in the middle of moving to a nice new house just outside of the city. I'm starting my own business soon in Xekko, providing the usual plugins and software, but also providing hospitality for local events.</p>
<h4>How much time do you spend on the MyBB project weekly?</h4>
<p>It depends really - usually on how much Ryan pesters me into doing something(!). I spend most of my day at work working with MyBB and if there's a bug or two hanging around I'll normally have a go at fixing it. My lovely girlfriend would like to point out at this time that she thinks I spend too much on the project.</p>
<h4>Apart from MyBB, what do some of your hobbies include?</h4>
<p>I like spending time outside and visiting the lakes (what's the point in living in a <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Lake%20District">natural park</a> and spend all day inside?), but I like going to the cinema and enjoying the nightlife too. I'm an avid fan of Guitar Hero - I'm the drummer of our band - where having a deaf neighbor comes in handy.</p>
<h4>What is a feature that you would like to see in MyBB one day and why?</h4>
<p>I don't really have a particular feature I would like to see in MyBB, to be honest - it's already the best "forum" software you can get without all the unnecessary addons you don't really need to run a community. Well, except for what's planned for MyBB 2...</p>
<p>I work with MyBB in so many applications that I know you can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<h4>If you could do anything you wanted for one day, what would it be?</h4>
<p>Hmm, a day without coding would be good! There's too many things for one day though; I would probably have to live the life of a celebrity (famous one), and go out for a night out I think. Can't really complain at getting free drinks all night...</p>
<h4>What made you want to join the MyBB staff?</h4>
<p>I started using MyBB for an open-sourced alternative to Invision. I had enough free time to help out other people and I quickly grasped (almost) all aspects of MyBB. I guess I just wanted to help people out as much as I could, and then the opportunity came to join the team. Now as a developer, I really enjoy giving people headaches with the bugs I cause. <img title="Shy" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/shy.gif" alt="Shy" /></p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about your job</h4>
<p>I really love my job; for the past two years, I've been a Marketing Designer and Systems Developer for one of the UK's largest suppliers of civil engineering and drainage products (basically, they sell the sort of things to build roads and houses or public/industrial buildings, and drainage systems for things like football stadiums, car parks etc). I mainly do all of their advertising, literature and posters as my marketing part, but the other part of my job is to develop software systems to help the company. The part I hate the most is the printing out. I enjoy designing all of the leaflets and things, but really, really hate printing anywhere up to 5,000 of them - then putting them all into envelopes and stamping them. I also look after their website (which I hate, as I didn't make it!) and I've just finished making an e-shop for all the products we sell. Of course, it's powered by MyBB. <img title="Tongue" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/tongue.gif" alt="Tongue" /></p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>In school, I did graphic design and always wanted to be a designer. So actually, I'm already in my dream career. A Ferrari or two wouldn't go a miss though...</p>
<h4>Your most memorable day was...</h4>
<p>I've had a few that come to mind, but I'll have to say my first day at work (where I work now). Before then, I was unemployed and getting into things I really shouldn't have done. It started a whole new chain of events which turned my life round for the better, and without that happening, I really don't know where I would be now. I met people that have truly changed my life, and I even met my girlfriend there too. So (so far), that's my memorable day.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>For those wanting to get into MyBB, don't underestimate it's ability to do whatever you want with it. It's structure and plugin system is the most powerful and easiest to learn out of all the free forum systems (and the paid ones too, come to mind). Take some time to learn it, and you'll find out just how much you can do with it.</p>
<p>Also, MyBB 2.0 will kick ass.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Sorry for the long delay, I've been busy with end of year school work. <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-13144.html">Doug</a> was eager to answer his questions, getting back to me less than a day after I sent his questions to him.</p>
<h4>Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I'm Doug Sisk and I live in the barren lands of South Dakota in the US. I started working with MyBB back in 2007 when I started doing web design. MyBB is what inspired me to learn PHP &amp; MySQL, and by the end of 2008, I was on the MyBB Team. Besides MyBB, I'm the technical administrator for the Roller Coaster Simulator website <a href="http://rctlounge.com/">RCTLounge</a>, I own an Amusement Park Blog, <a href="http://parkthoughts.com/">Park Thoughts</a>, and I do some projects through my personal company, amply named <a href="http://www.dougsisk.com/">Doug Sisk Design</a>. I'm a Junior in High School, and I'm very active in band, participating in Marching, Concert, and Jazz band. I play synthesizer in Marching, piano in Jazz, and percussion in Concert. I also enjoy dreaming about Roller Coasters, watching TV, and hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>I was on the SQA team from November 2008-2009, and I am now a developer. I will be assisting in bug fixing the upcoming 1.6 series, and I will be also developing features for the future 2.0 series.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite gadget and why?</h4>
<p>I don't think I have a "favorite" gadget. I love my Computer, iPod Touch, and cell phone equally. The computer is where my work is, my iPod Touch has all the music and podcasts I enjoy, and my cell phone lets me keep in touch with friends. Between the iPod and cell phone though, I would choose the iPod as my favorite. It's great being able to keep up with the stuff I follow online right from it. I watch a ton of <a href="http://revision3.com/">Revision3</a> shows, mainly Diggnation, Tekzilla, and Film Riot. I occasionally watch Scam School from time to time.</p>
<h4>Describe to us what it means to you to be on the MyBB team.</h4>
<p>For me, being on the MyBB Team is a honor. This software is the best out there. There are very few free software programs out there that have the dedication and support like MyBB. It always amazes me how dedicated everyone is to the project for not being paid. For me, the payment is knowing that thousands of people have a way to communicate for free. It's still hard for me to believe that I'm part of such a huge project.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite feature of MyBB?</h4>
<p>I really don't know what my favorite feature in MyBB is. I'm sure I'll have one come 2.0 series!</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>When I was younger, my dream career was to go into the Amusement Park Industry. However, as I've grown older, I've realized that it isn't what I want to do everyday of my work life. I have done so well at web design and development, that it has already turned into a job rather than a hobby for me. I don't think there are many people that can say they make money from their hobby!</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Other than MyBB, I spend time checking up on the websites I work with, and the rest of the websites I follow. I mainly check out Facebook, Twitter (@<a href="http://twitter.com/DougSD">DougSD</a>), and Digg. I also make my rounds looking at Web Design galleries and blogs to see what the trends are. When I'm not on computer, I'm usually listening to music (my favorite bands are Jack's Mannequin and Something Corporate), playing piano, drumming, drawing random sketches of websites and things, or watching TV (my favorite shows are Mythbusters, The Office, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon).</p>
<h4>Where do you see yourself in 10 years time?</h4>
<p>I have no clue where I'll be in 10 years. Hopefully, I'll be at a successful web design or marketing agency.</p>
<h4>What is your favourite programming language?</h4>
<p>PHP, as it's the only language I know fluently. I have a brief knowledge of jQuery and Javascript, but it's far from great. I've attempted to learn Ruby, but I gave up. Not my cup of tea.</p>
<h4>Who inspires you?</h4>
<p>The web design firm that has inspired me since I started in 2007 is <a href="http://electricpulp.com/">Electric Pulp</a>, South Dakota's best web design firm. They always have outstanding designs. I get all my inspiration from viewing galleries. My favorite gallery I check weekly is <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com/">Best Web Gallery</a>. It really is nice to see the wide ranges of design types being used.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>I don't really think I have much else to say. I think I got everything about me down. I'm not always one for giving out information online, but I don't mind giving out a little about me.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-2165.html">Ryan Gordon</a> was second to answer your questions, he must have thought they were bugs cause he had the answers the day after me asking them.</p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m Ryan Gordon, and I live in the Bay Area of California, USA. I’ve been on the MyBB team since April 2006, back in the days of MyBB 1.1. I’m currently an intern for a SQA position during my summers, and school during the school year. In my other time I run various websites, I work with my Robotics Club (helping get financing &amp; partners, doing programming and occasionally mechanical or electrical jobs), and I also do some freelance and for-fun coding. I love playing soccer, and have played soccer for most of my life. In my free time I love talking and hanging out with friends, joking, gaming, and going to the movies.</p>
<h4>Does your brother ever annoy you when you're programming MyBB?</h4>
<p>All the time :(</p>
<h4>What's it like helping administrate the largest known MyBB forum, with over 4 million posts (NCAABBS)?</h4>
<p>It's definitely interesting. You learn a lot of what it takes to run an operation that big in terms of programming optimizations, security, and stability as well as managing it well.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>I love playing soccer in my spare time. I also am on a robotics club, and who would've guessed? I'm the main programmer.</p>
<h4>How does an average day look for you?</h4>
<p>Weekdays I wake up at 8:00am and get into work by 9:30am. I get off work at 5:00pm and drive myself through commute traffic back to home. At around 6:00pm I have my dinner and turn on the computer. During the next few hours, I try to enjoy a TV show or two on Hulu.com and talk to friends. Otherwise I am on the MyBB Community forums and my other various projects to check up on and do my job. I end up going to sleep anywhere between 10pm and 3am.<br />
Weekends usually call for some relaxing, going to the movies or hanging out with friends, chores, et cetera. Of course, during the school year, my days are filled with assignments.</p>
<h4>What is your favorite book?</h4>
<p>I must admit, I was raised a Harry Potter fan. My closet however is filled with programming books, some half read, some my bibles, some I've scanned over. The Dan Brown books are also among my favorites.</p>
<h4>What feature have you always wanted in MyBB but has not yet been included?</h4>
<p>Automatic updates. That would be killer =) Will definitely be in MyBB 2.0</p>
<h4>What is your favorite language, both programming and real languages?</h4>
<p>PHP is definitely the language for me. English is also my favorite real language.</p>
<h4>Is MyBB your only developing project on the internet or are you involved in others?</h4>
<p>I do periodic work for clients (creating a website here and there), I also have my own RCT3 Fansite that I have co-owned and have continued to run for 4 years.</p>
<h4>What initially attracted you to MyBB?</h4>
<p>My first RCT3 Fansite ran a phpBB 2 forum. Me and the owner decided we wanted something with a little more functionality. At the same time, I had known and had been friends with Justin S., our now Lead Designer, who also ran a RCT3 Fansite and was looking for a better forum to replace phpBB 2 with. He found MyBB, and he linked me to it. It was definately a much better choice and we chose it. At the time this was going on, I was learning the basic web programming languages, including PHP. I put my PHP skills to the test by first creating plugins and soon after, I got hooked.</p>
<h4>What is the most trouble you've ever been in?</h4>
<p>That's a hard question to answer. I would say some of the fights and tantrums me and my brother would use to have, would get us in lots of trouble.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>I would say, owning and creating a theme park on the ranks of Disneyland/Great America has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<h4>Anything else you want to add?</h4>
<p>Just a few interesting facts about me I guess:<br />
I hate California weather because I like it when it rains - It is peaceful, cleansing, and something different then the norm.<br />
I program best at the late hours of the night, because I am not bothered by noises, people or issues much; it allows me to focus and get things done.<br />
I have a knack for making people laugh with my jokes when I'm not in a working environment and I love to make people smile.</p>

        <p><a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1830.html">Justin S.</a> is the first team member to have a go at answering questions, so be nice to him.</p>
<h4>Tell us a bit about yourself</h4>
<p>Hi, I’m Justin, and I live in Central Ohio, USA. I’ve been on the MyBB team since April 2006, back in the days of MyBB 1.1. I’m currently a junior in high school. In my free time, I run a roller coaster simulator fansite called <a href="http://rctgo.net">RCTgo</a>, and also do some web design through my portfolio, <a href="http://bellomandesign.com/">Belloman Design</a>. I obviously love roller coasters, and I play the alto saxophone in my school’s jazz, concert, and marching bands.</p>
<h4>How did you discover MyBB?</h4>
<p>My experience with forums all began through the RollerCoaster Tycoon community, so it’s fitting that I found MyBB through one of those forums. I already had a bit of experience administrating forums when I discovered MyBB, as I had already created a forum of my own with InvisionFree. Anyway, at some point I had found a forum of Sebar’s (a notable member of the RCT community), which was running MyBB. I knew a bit about forum softwares at that point – notably vB, IPB, and phpBB – but had never heard of MyBB.</p>
<p>Eventually, I decided to check out the website, downloaded a copy of MyBB and installed it on my web hosting account. I fell in love instantly – even at PR2, it had just about everything I wanted, and was enough of an incentive to completely start over my forum with it. It’s been nearly four years since I discovered MyBB and I’m still in love with it.</p>
<h4>Describe some of the roles you have taken on in the MyBB team</h4>
<p>When I first became a member of the MyBB team, I was added alongside Ryan Gordon as one of the official MyBB Wiki managers. We were tasked with maintaining the wiki, ensuring all of the articles were of a high quality, and that all of the appropriate articles were there.</p>
<p>At some point, I was asked to redesign the MyBB website. A redesign had already been in progress, but we (the team) felt that it could use a bit of a “refresh.” I guess you could say that is where I began my role as designer.</p>
<p>For MyBB 1.4, I created the layouts for countless pages in the new MyBB Admin CP. I’d say roughly two-thirds of the layouts were done by me in HTML mockups. At the same time, I also wrote almost all of the wiki documentation for the new features and changes in MyBB 1.4, most noticeably rewriting nearly all of the wiki articles for the Admin CP.</p>
<p>Today, my roles are MyBB Lead Designer and Wiki Lead. I’m responsible for almost every new layout that goes into MyBB, as well as (on the side) making sure the Wiki is up to date and being well maintained.</p>
<h4>Which program/tool do you enjoy using the most while designing the new layout and graphics for MyBB?</h4>
<p>Pencil and paper go a long way when initially mocking up layouts. With an eraser in hand, I can easily brainstorm how I want a page laid out, as it often takes a bit of time to get something that’s “just right.” Another great thing about paper mockups is that they’re obviously strictly layout, not theme, which I think is important in early stages.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I’ve been using a program called <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq Mockups</a>, which is a fantastic tool that tries to imitate pencil and paper mockups. It’s really easy to get things looking exactly how I want them, and I think I’m going to be using it quite a bit more in the future.</p>
<p>Here are some pencil mockups that Justin did for 1.4.</p>
<div class="float_left" style="margin-right:10px;"><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/mybb001.jpg" title="Mod CP pencil mockup"><img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/mybb001.jpg?w=180&amp;h=100" alt="Mod CP pencil mockup" title="Mod CP pencil mockup" class="inline_illustration" /></a>

</div>
<h4 style="clear:both;">How much time do you spend designing MyBB? Describe the process of being a designer of MyBB.</h4>
<p>When I’m designing a new layout for MyBB, I’ll often start with a paper sketch or a mockup in Balsamiq Mockups, experimenting and fine tuning the layout to exactly how I think it should be. At this point, I’ll usually show it to Ryan Gordon, and finally to the rest of the MyBB staff for input. Once a decent amount of input has been received, I’ll typically open up a text editor and begin creating an HTML mockup, which gives the developers a clear picture of how I envision the layout to look. I’ll then do the same: show it to Ryan Gordon and finally to the rest of the staff for review. Finally, a developer will eventually come in and commit the feature, based on the mockups I created.</p>
<p>I do not keep track of how much time I spend on any particular design or on designing MyBB in general. I do it whenever I have free time.</p>
<h4>What feature did you want MyBB to have that was never included?</h4>
<p>Soft delete. As someone who is paranoid about deleting things, I would love to have the option to “delete” posts without actually deleting them. A lot of people suggest to simply unapprove posts that you want to keep but not delete, but that doesn’t work too well: it clutters up the moderation queue, and isn’t really what I consider unapproved posts to be for.</p>
<h4>Other than MyBB, what are some of your hobbies?</h4>
<p>Roller coasters, web design, architecture, band, and reading.</p>
<h4>What do you have for breakfast each day?</h4>
<p>I typically eat some combination of bagels, muffins, waffles, pancakes, French toast, and yogurt. I hardly ever skip breakfast.</p>
<h4>What was the meaning behind your former username, Belloman?</h4>
<p>I’m afraid I’m not going to answer this question. I always like to keep a few secrets about myself.</p>
<h4>What was your favorite nursery rhyme?</h4>
<p>I’m not sure if this is the proper title or if it was my favorite, but “It’s raining, it’s pouring,” comes to mind.</p>
<h4>What is your dream career?</h4>
<p>Architecture. I have always been in love with buildings and maps, and I think something related to architecture or engineering is a perfect fit for my interests.</p>
<h4>Anything else you would like to add?</h4>
<p>Being on the MyBB team has truly been a life-changing experience, and I don’t think I will ever regret joining the team. I’m also really looking forward to seeing what the future holds for MyBB – whatever it is, I’m sure it’ll be great!</p>

        <p>Greetings all. Today we've got a little update on the MyBB staff.</p>
<h4>Returning and new staff members</h4>
<p>Firstly, we welcome back <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1428.html">nickman</a>. nickman was with us previously on the development team and has now offered to rejoin us on the SQA team. When he was on the developers' team he worked mainly on bug fixes, and SQA is all about bug fixes and offering possible fixes. Please make him feel welcome again.</p>
<p>Please also welcome <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17942.html">Joshua Mayer</a>. Joshua is very active and has been a great help to members who request various forms of support.</p>
<h4>Staff member leaves</h4>
<p>Today we say goodbye to <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-1923.html">Sergio Montoya</a> who has been a developer with us for the past year. He leaves us to focus more on his personal and real life. We hope you join us in wishing him the best of luck in his future.  <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-17470.html">Sayakb</a> has been moved to the development team to fill Sergio's place.</p>
