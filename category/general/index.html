Discussion about bridging 1.x closer to 2.0 has been settling, and as such we have decided on the best course of action moving forward. This comes with some other updates, including the main site going responsive, our blog getting way more fun, setting up an official demo site, and speeding up that darn extension approval process.</p>

<h2 id="mybbcom">MyBB.com</h2>

<p>If you’ve browsed our site lately on mobile, you may have noticed that it can be a real pain to navigate. We believe it is time to change that. Rather than awaiting MyBB 2 to bring our website into the modern age, you can expect it to be updated <strong><em>very</em></strong> soon. The new site will feature a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modern Design - <em>We are making sure to get the site up to modern design standards.</em></li>
  <li>Fully Responsive - <em>This is part of a larger goal to get all MyBB products responsive, we’re starting with the main site.</em></li>
  <li>SEO - <em>Finding pages on MyBB should be a much better experience through search engines.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some time and want to leave some feedback, or if you just want to look at the new design, please visit the thread or repository linked below. Thanks!</p>

<p>Our blog will be getting some love as well. We’re now creating our blog posts via a repository on GitHub, so you can help (Or just get a sneak peek at what the next blog will be about). If you have an idea for a blog post that we haven’t done yet, or think we could be doing something better, feel free to open an issue in the repository linked below.</p>

<h2 id="official-demo-site">Official Demo Site</h2>

<p>You may or may not know this, but we keep the community forum as vanilla as possible so users can get a feel for what MyBB is, right out of the box. Unfortunately this limits some decisions we make where improving the community forum is concerned. Not only that, but it limits how users can explore a vanilla MyBB installation as well. We are going to be creating a demo website to solve both of these issues, allowing you as users to browse a clean installation of MyBB easily. Obviously these demo installs will be lacking a couple of features that a full blown install contains, such as the ability to install custom themes and plugins - this is purely a security precaution.</p>

<p>Providing a clean demo system for users also opens up the possibility for more changes to be made to the official community forum - such as updating the styling to fit in with the rest of the website - in the future.</p>

<p>You can expect work to begin on this project after the new website has launched. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>

<h2 id="mybb-extensions">MyBB Extensions</h2>

<h3 id="approval-process">Approval Process</h3>

<p>It’s no secret that getting a modification approved on the MyBB website can be a slow process. The main offender for this is our mission to make sure submissions are safe and of good quality, which means exploring the code and installing them for ourselves. This just isn’t a sustainable practice and results in a lot of frustration.</p>

<p>To speed up your addon submissions, we’re going to be easing our policy for allowing submissions. The policy has been published in our documentation, check it out at the following link.</p>

<p>If you find an issue with one of these unapproved addons, or even one that has been approved, please report it to us via the Private Inquiries forum so we can investigate properly.</p>

<h3 id="paid-modification-support">Paid Modification Support</h3>

<p>We are also taking a look into our support of paid modifications. In the past, these have been banned from being posted anywhere on the forum. Paid authors create some great things, so we’d like to embrace them more going forward. Our current solution is allowing paid modifications in the Requests/Services/Jobs forum, which you can find below.</p>

<p>We’re also considering the possibility of adding thread prefixes to the Requests/Services/Jobs forum in an effort to easily distinguish the types of services available. If you have any suggestions regarding these categories, we’re all ears!</p>

<h2 id="mybb-software-development-path">MyBB Software Development Path</h2>

<p>After a lot of discussion internally, on the forum and in Discord, we’ve decided on the path that the MyBB software will be following leading up to MyBB 2. While we can all agree that MyBB needs to be more modern, rewriting it entirely from scratch is an enormous task and is taking much longer than we anticipated. Judging from the input from users, as well as discussion among staff, our best option moving forward will be to further bridge the 1.x series toward MyBB 2, while updating it to be more usable and modern.</p>

<p><img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/17-screen.png" alt="MyBB Poll results" /></p>

<p>We have not decided on any specifics, but have discussed some of the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Twig</li>
  <li>Use Sass</li>
  <li>New, responsive theme</li>
  <li>Improved user experience, meaning changes like alerts or conversations</li>
</ul>

<p>All that we know for now is that the MyBB 1.x line needs to be improved, and we need your help on deciding what exactly will be changing. If you’d like to join in on the discussion, head over to the forum thread we’ve been using to discuss the software.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/2016/10/13/project-updates-october-2016/">This past October</a>, we announced a comprehensive update was in the works for <a href="https://community.mybb.com/mods.php">Extend MyBB</a>. Today, we are pleased to announce that those changes are now live. As we mentioned then, the entire Extend MyBB platform has been completely redesigned with a new, far more intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>The majority of the functionality remains the same; however, there have been some notable changes and improvements worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>What's changed?</h3>
<h4>New build review process</h4>
<p>Previously, when a new build was uploaded, it was marked as a <em>dev</em> build. These builds were available for download to the public. You could then mark a build as <em>stable</em>, which would then place the build in a queue for a member of the MyBB staff to review. This queue often became long, leading to siginifcant delays in reviewing builds. Additionally, the distinction between dev builds and stable builds was not abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Starting today, for both new and existing projects, you will be able to mark builds as development or stable at any time without any review from MyBB staff. Instead, there is a new <em>Reviewed by Staff</em> badge and queue, separate from the dev/stable status, to distinguish builds that have been reviewed by the MyBB staff. Both dev builds and stable builds can be submitted for review by MyBB staff. Whether or not a build has been reviewed by MyBB staff is indicated on the build's download page.</p>
<p>All builds that, prior to today, had been marked as stable are now also marked as <em>Reviewed by Staff</em>.</p>
<h4>Build version numbering</h4>
<p>You can now specify a version number for each build rather than relying on the change logs and build numbers to differentiate between builds. Build version numbers do <em>not</em> have to be unique, meaning, for instance, you can upload development builds of a new version of a plugin before uploading a stable build with the same version number. When uploading a new build or editing an existing build, you also have the option of automatically updating the <em>project's</em> version number to match the build you are uploading or editing.</p>
<h4>Recommendations are now Stars</h4>
<p>Recommendations have been renamed to stars. The functionality is identical; however, you can now see a listing of all projects that you have starred by going to your <em>My Projects</em> page and clicking on <em>Stars</em>. We felt the name change was appropriate given this added functionality.</p>
<h4>Select multiple categories</h4>
<p>There are often plugins (and themes) that fall into multiple categories. Previously, you were required to select a single category that best described your project. No more. You can now select multiple categories for plugin, theme, and graphics projects, or, if none of them fit, you don't have to select any category (eliminating the "Miscellaneous" categories). Most of the plugin categories remain unchanged; however, theme categories have changed significantly and <strong>most themes will need to select a new category</strong>.</p>
<h4>Translations improvements</h4>
<p>In an effort to make finding the MyBB translation for your language easier, we have streamlined translations projects to ensure they will be more consistent moving forward. <strong>Translations can no longer upload preview images</strong>; instead, there are a number of pre-defined languages with pre-selected flags that you can choose from when uploading a translation. If the language for the translation you are uploading is not available, you can manually specify the language. However, we encourage you to contact us in <a href="https://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">Private Inquiries</a> so your language can be added to the drop down menu, allowing a flag to be displayed alongside your translation.</p>
<h4>Changes to preview images</h4>
<p>Preview images can now be re-ordered rather than being displayed in an arbitrary order. Additionally, we now recommend you upload a <strong>square</strong> image of at least 200px x 200px for your cover image.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to changes with thumbnail sizes for all preview images, it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you <strong>re-upload your preview images</strong> so that the thumbnails can be re-generated at the appropriate size.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>A lot of time has been spent in redesigning and improving the MyBB Extend platform and we hope you find it easier to use. While it has undergone significant testing, it is still likely that there will be a few bugs in the upgraded platform. Please post about any bugs or issues you experience in the <a href="https://community.mybb.com/forum-19.html">MyBB.com Community &amp; Site Issues forum</a>, including detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

        <p>As the MyBB 2.0 development gains traction again &mdash; a joint effort of the Team and our technical Community &mdash; we are passing an important milestone in the area of the Project's organization. Entirely new concepts, de-facto standards and unspoken rules, either improving the fluency within the Team or aimed at increasing MyBB's maturity (and sometimes both), are being continuously brainstormed. We would like to share our progress so far in areas we are confident about.</p>
<h3>PSR standards conformance from MyBB 2.0</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>World Standards Day</i> / <i>International standards day</i> is celebrated internationally each year on 14 October. [...] The United States held a 2014 U.S. Celebration [...] on 23 October [...].</p>
<footer><i>&mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Standards_Day">Wikipedia</a></i></footer>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>Currently our coding standards are rather specific when compared to other projects in the PHP Community, and may be perceived unnatural (exhibit A: <a href="https://docs.mybb.com/1.8/development/standards/">1.8 development standards</a>) &mdash; <strong>starting from 2.0, MyBB's source will be fully conformant with <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/">PSR standards</a></strong>. While this means that we will be inevitably choosing a standardized side in <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/57/tabs-versus-spaces-what-is-the-proper-indentation-character-for-everything-in-e">one of the greatest arguments</a> in the history of programming, which we have been avoiding for some time (exhibit B: <a href="https://blog.mybb.com/2015/08/16/2-0-dev-post-5/">2.0 Dev Post #5</a>), this decision will assure that our code preserves compatibility of coding style with <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/members/">other PHP projects and frameworks</a>. This should lessen the confusion in Pull Requests and allow new contributors to adapt more easily.</p>
<h3>Secure connections to *.mybb.com websites</h3>
<p>A simple visit to any of our websites involves many platforms and servers: by connecting to our Documentation on <a href="https://docs.mybb.com">docs.mybb.com</a>, your requests go through our reverse proxy (currently provided by CloudFlare) to hit our Jekyll-powered website hosted on GitHub Pages from the <a href="https://github.com/mybb/docs.mybb.com">Docs repository</a>, whereas requests to the Blog you are reading this article on go to <i>WordPress.com</i> platform servers instead after following a similar path. Spreading <a href="https://mybb.com/about/ecosystem/">our web presence</a> in such decentralized manner has great advantages with independent availability being the most significant one, however maintaining them all becomes more complicated and introduces security risks with each addition.</p>
<p>In order to aid that, we have launched efforts to start <strong>enforcing HTTPS traffic to our websites and inserting security-related HTTP headers</strong> &mdash; although we don't control external servers, we were able to set up the most important redirects and directives using the reverse proxy; these changes, combined with Subresource Integrity hashes for external content served on <a href="https://mybb.com">mybb.com</a> and <a href="https://docs.mybb.com">docs.mybb.com</a>, provide a reasonable level of security given access limitations for any project that decides to set up their infrastructure in this fashion. If you happen to <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json">randomly browse</a> the Chromium source code, you will discover that the <code>mybb.com</code> domain is now present on the HSTS preload list, making derived browsers enforce HTTPS upon first visit out of the box, helping our case a great deal.</p>
<p>Having control over the server hosting the Community forums and download Resources, we set up additional security headers that are now sent to the browser from both locations and our MyBB installation to serve cookies with the <i>Secure</i> flag, a feature shipped with MyBB 1.8.10. By using a MyBB <a href="https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&amp;pid=450">plugin</a> with a Node.js <a href="https://github.com/atmos/camo">proxy server</a>, external resources on our forums are now being delivered to users over a secure connection, resolving the issue of insecure content and enhancing their privacy by eliminating the necessity of downloading data directly from third party servers. Even when either one breaks, the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header will prevent insecure content from being loaded (the next major version of MyBB will make it possible to include all common security headers, as we will be aiming to eliminate obstacles like inline JavaScript).</p>
<p>You can take a closer look at the gritty details of our current setup <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=mybb.com">here</a> and <a href="https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html?host=community.mybb.com">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Team members' PGP keys now available</h3>
<p>The transition of our development process, now headed towards MyBB 2.0, largely impacts the organizational matters of the Project itself &mdash; one of recent preparations for an improved release management protocol that are easy to spot is the <strong>rollout of PGP keys that can be used to contact Team members</strong>, if you have a feeling that your messages sometimes have more recipients than they should (or if you'd rather be safe than sorry and use it out of principle, like we do). These can be found on our refurbished <a href="https://mybb.com/about/team/">Team page</a> that now also links accounts on social media, acting as backup channels of communication.</p>
<h3>Packages integrity and authenticity measures</h3>
<p>While keys and fingerprints present themselves excellent on our website, they won't be used (only) for aesthetic purposes: <strong>we will start signing MyBB releases</strong>. Designated Team members will be able to submit a public key that will be added an announced on our website and and social media feeds for transparency purposes.<br />
Further, while the hashing algorithm used for internal file verification and passwords in MyBB 1.8 is <a href="https://community.mybb.com/post-1156249.html">weak in today's standards</a> due to the codebase's age, there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to verifying the packages. If you've been paying attention to the release notes, you've probably noticed that we started <strong>publishing additional, stronger checksums</strong> for each release package as of MyBB 1.8.8. These actions are intended to provide webmasters with a degree of confidence when it comes to integrity of MyBB packages while still maintaining focus on the development of MyBB 2.</p>
<h3>Vulnerability assessment with CVSS v3</h3>
<p>We always have been trying to provide as much information as we could when it came to security patches after an update, however we were not quite satisfied with limiting the security issue index to a simple low-medium-high scale used in MyBB 1.x. MyBB's <a href="https://mybb.com/about/rfcs/9-cvss-v3-as-vulnerability-assessment-scale-for-2-x/">RFC #9</a> has established one of major foundations of the security process, <strong>starting with MyBB 2.0: Each vulnerability fixed in given release will have a CVSS v3 score assigned</strong>, as specified in the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss">Common Vulnerability Scoring System, V3</a> document. The 8 basic metrics will allow us and any third party user, team or organization to assess the exploitability, scope and impact of vulnerabilities and to adjust the rating by adding extra details within the same scale using <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i3">Temporal</a> and <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i4">Environmental</a> Metrics, allowing system administrators to prioritize and organize proper responses. For example, a SQL Injection vulnerability in the Moderator Control Panel could be assigned a score of <i>6.3 (Medium)</i> comprising of base metrics <code>CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L</code>, all of which would be published in release notes of corresponding releases.</p>
<h3>Spotlight on security research</h3>
<p>Another significant part of the Project's organization plans is to <strong>launch a Security Hall of Fame</strong>. Researchers reporting security issues and vulnerabilities, provided they follow responsible disclosure standards, will be placed on a dedicated list in recognition of their time and cooperation. In accordance, <strong>MyBB will promote post-incident analyses and write-ups</strong>, aiming at increasing security awareness and promoting community-based code reviews. To supply you with latest details and articles related to MyBB's state of security, we have launched a dedicated, technical Twitter feed &mdash; make sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mybbsecurity"><strong>@mybbsecurity</strong></a> to let us help you maintain a strong grip over your board's security.</p></p>

        <p>The Web has been using encrypted WWW connections for over two decades now. First used by entities processing critical information on the Internet like banks and online shops, <code>https://</code> is progressively becoming the protocol an everyday user would expect as of 2016: the Google Transparency Report <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/metrics">shows</a> that the average number of page loads over HTTPS has exceeded 50%, similarly to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xjosh/status/786971412959420424">telemetry data</a> trends from Mozilla, aided by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">Let's Encrypt</a>, a new certificate authority issuing free certificates since April.</p>
<p>With the dependency on Internet communications heavier than ever, simple and common mistakes often result in leaks and breaches that endanger not only the security or integrity of services, but also the privacy of their users: passwords, real names, locations, e-mail and IP addresses, browsing patterns and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information">personally identifiable information</a>. Even static websites receive such data and <strong>the argument of not expecting to process sensitive information is not valid</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>TLS has exactly one performance problem: it is not used widely enough.<br />
Everything else can be optimized.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The range of possible attacks on unsecured websites is broad and you may not always be aware of the risks of providing and using websites using the unencrypted version of HTTP. Simply launching a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot in a public place can allow anyone to intercept raw traffic without much hassle. Similarly, Internet service providers and mobile network operators can <a href="http://time.com/3999527/att-nsa-spying/">allow</a> governments to put their hands (however tiny they might be &mdash; the governments, of course) on your data regardless of intent or permissions, be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/19/extreme-surveillance-becomes-uk-law-with-barely-a-whimper">forced</a> to do so by the law or have their communications <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/over-1-million-russians-could-be-surveillance-targets-by-years-end/a-36113272">eavesdropped</a> by passive interception of traffic.</p>
<p>Besides protecting services and people, upgrading the protocol has many upsides — the new HTTP/2, increasing the speed of web connections, is available only when used with encryption; using HTTPS, Google will prioritize your website in the search results. Encrypted transmissions mean that nobody will be able to manipulate your pages to inject malware or own ads, which is often the case with public access points or airplane connections. In order to push the adoption of encryption, major browsers will start <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure">notifying</a> <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html">users</a> of the dangers resulting from using unsecured websites. MyBB is proud to support this movement of creating a faster and safer web.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2949" align="alignnone" width="640"]<a href="https://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/https-community-mybb-com.png"><img class="wp-image-2949 size-large" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/https-community-mybb-com.png?w=640" alt="Chrome for Android UI's HTTPS indication" width="640" height="158" /></a> <em>Secure connection to the Community forums — so claims Chrome for Android</em>[/caption]</p>
<p>The HTTPS setup tools are being constantly improved and the process is getting easier and faster, moreover you can find numerous guides and tutorials for different platforms and scripts. What's been missing though, is a list of steps specific to MyBB because not every board administrator is experienced enough to make use of instructions that are either very generalized or very specific — for scripts other than ours.<br />
Having jumped into the rabbit hole of technical details of securing our project's websites and climbed back (which we'll shed light on soon!), <strong>we created a comprehensive guidebook on enabling HTTPS</strong> that covers the most vital aspects of securing boards you manage.<br />
We strongly recommend all webmasters and administrators upgrade their installations if they're not running on HTTPS yet as soon as possible and encourage to consider the security and privacy of their users with utmost importance: every secured location makes a difference in today's interconnected web.</p>

        <p>As there have been a number of changes to both the team structure and some development going on, we thought it was time to share some updates on what's been happening behind the scenes.</p>
<h2>Team Changes</h2>
<p>There have been a number of changes to the structure of the team over the last couple of months, with a few people leaving, some fresh new faces and some familiar faces returning to the team.</p>
<h4>Resignations</h4>
<p>We wish farewell to the following team members, and thank them for all of their hard work and contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-23276.html">Leefish</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-37431.html">Paul H.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-43697.html">Josh H</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-69212.html">ATofighi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-13376.html">Eric J</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these members left the team because they had limited time. We wish them all the best and we would welcome them back should they find the time to contribute to the project again.</p>
<h4>Additions</h4>
<p>As well as departures, we also have some new (and some not-so-new) faces joining the ranks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-24419.html">dragonexpert</a> - Recently joined the support team again! He has been helping clear the mods queue since he rejoined the team and we can only thank him for his hard work so far.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-58598.html">Shade</a> - Shade has rejoined us on the SQA team, we welcome him back and we are sure that he will contribute to the project.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-10902.html">Brad-T</a> - We invited brad to the team to help share his community management expertise with us. We are sure he will help with community issues!</li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-69440.html">Matslom</a> - If you have been following the 2.0 GitHub repo you will see Matslom has been contributing for some time now, including coding the warning system.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-55383.html">Wildcard</a> - Another old team member who joined us back, we welcome him back and we are sure he will contribute fully.</li>
<li><a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-51459.html">JordanMussi</a> - Jordan is also a old team member who has joined the community team, We are glad to have him back on board!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mods Site Queue</h2>
<p>It has been no secret for a while that we have had quite a back log of modification submissions waiting to be checked by the team as part of our extensive approval process. With a special thanks to dragonexpert and shade, the mods queue has taken a severe beating over the last couple of weeks, with there being no projects waiting for review for a short time for the first time in a long time!</p>
<p>As ever, if you've submitted a project and not heard anything about it being approved or denied, please do feel free to create a new topic in <a href="https://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">the Private Inquiries forum</a>.</p>
<h2>1.8 Development</h2>
<p>Over the recent weeks we have had a lot of development progress on the MyBB 1.8 series. A lot of issues have been either getting PR's fixing them or we have been rejecting them due to the age of the 1.8 series. We have also been reviewing the 1.8 bugs forum and highlighting any issues we felt need to be fixed. We are looking to get the issues on GitHub to current issues that need to be fixed before we move complete focus (except security fixes) to 2.0. Due to the high amount of bug reports we have been unable to reply to every issue but we have compiled an internal list and we are looking at this.</p>
<h2>2.0 Development</h2>
<p>Recent development on the 2.0 series has been slow, but recently we have seen a large increase in contributions from outside the team. <a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-69440.html">Matslom</a> (who has since joined the team), for instance recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb2/pull/268">a great Pull Request to add a warning system to 2.0</a> which has now been merged into the main branch. Additionally, <a href="https://community.mybb.com/user-102869.html">Paradigm</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/036/mybb2/tree/AutoInstaller">implementing an installer system for 2.0</a> - something that has been planned for a while and kept being bumped down the priority list.</p>
<p>A lot of the discussion around these developments has been happening on the #20-development channel on <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-198398.html">the MyBB Discord server</a>, and we would encourage anybody interested in contributing to the development of MyBB to pop in and see what's going on!</p>

        <p>Recently we have made a number of notable changes to the community and MyBB website. We'd like to share with you what we've done and how you can get involved.</p>
<h3>RFC Process and transparency policy</h3>
<p>For over a year now, the MyBB Team has been using an internal <i>Request For Comments</i> process as a decision making mechanism for issues with high impact on the Project's present and future as well as a mean of assuring team-wide consensus on matters related to its organization and development. Recently we have decided to start <strong>publishing our RFC documents</strong>, putting us closer to the goal of <strong><a href="https://mybb.com/about/rfcs/6-documentation-and-transparency-standards/">maximum transparency</a></strong>. Accordingly, solid plans, workflows and protocols explaining what exactly happens behind the scenes will be posted on our websites as they emerge to enable external feedback and simplify the process of Team onboarding.</p>
<p>You can find all RFC documents that were cleared for disclosure in a <a href="https://mybb.com/about/rfcs/">dedicated section</a> on MyBB.com.</p>
<h3>Code of Conduct in force</h3>
<p>As previously <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-198748.html">announced</a>, we have joined an <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/">impressive group</a> of open source projects you may already have heard of by <strong>adopting a Code of Conduct</strong> provided by the Contributor Covenant. This addition allows us to centralize rules and guidelines that apply in our development and community ecosystems in order to assure professional and inviting environment for everyone interested in getting involved. You can find the new document <a href="https://mybb.com/about/conduct/">on our website</a>.</p>
<h3>Moving to Discord from IRC</h3>
<p>The MyBB IRC channel over at <a href="https://freenode.net">freenode</a> has not been bustling with activity for a while despite several attempts to bring it to life, so internally we discussed and tested alternatives to IRC. Looking for something that is easier for the whole community to engage with, we circled in <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>, which fulfills our needs for accessibility and moderation features. We <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-198398.html">invited the community</a> to help us during the testing phase and are grateful for those that did - you can already find many members of the MyBB Team on Discord in addition to other valued members of our Community.</p>
<p>While the adoption of the platform appears to be successful, we've decided to continue maintaining our IRC presence at <code>#mybb</code> and registered a freenode group to gain more control over our channels. In order to keep the chit-chat uniform, we plan to connect it to Discord using a bot that forwards messages both ways from the IRC channel to its counterpart on Discord — this will assure that no question will go unnoticed.</p>
<p>We'll see you there!</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.gg/rX8VpBr">Join the conversation →</a></p>
<h3>Up Next: Updates to Extend MyBB</h3>
<p>While not ready to go live just yet, we are excited to share an update on something Justin, our lead designer, has been working on for the past few weeks: a major visual update to the Extend MyBB platform, commonly known as the <em>MyBB Mods site</em>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2874,2880,2881,2875,2892" type="rectangular" link="file"]</p>
<p>The visual update touches all public-facing aspects of Extend MyBB, simplifying navigation and making its interface easier to use while maintaining existing features. There's still some more work to do before it's ready to launch, but we're sure you'll love it.</p>

        <p>MyBB 1.8 was released almost 9 months ago (September 1st, 2014 for those keeping track) and has since proven to be stable. Therefore we will be concluding maintenance and support for the MyBB 1.6 series, and we encourage everyone who has not already done so to upgrade to MyBB 1.8 as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>The end of life date for MyBB 1.6 will be the 1st of September, 2015.</strong></p>
<p>After this date:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not be offering official support for MyBB 1.6.</li>
<li>There will be no further maintenance or security releases for the 1.6 series.</li>
<li>The 1.6 support forums will be closed and archived.</li>
</ul>

        <p>MyBB has historically used the Lesser GNU Public License Version 3 (LGPL3) for the MyBB 1.8 series, and the GNU Public License Version 3 (GPL3) in earlier releases.</p>
<p>Both of these licenses are open source licenses, though both have a fair few limitations. The basic limitations of these licenses are best described <a href="https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)">by TLDRLegal.</a></p>
<p>For MyBB 2.0, we decided that we wanted to follow a much more clear and simple licensing model. Several licenses were considered, including the extremely open MIT license. In the end, it was decided that both MyBB 2.0 and all of the associated libraries will be released under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">the BSD 3 Clause (BSD-3) license,</a> which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Copyright (c) 2015, MyBB Group<br />

<p>This license is much simpler than previous licenses, and has the following basic limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the MyBB Group trademark or the names, trademarks or logos of any of the project's contributors.</li>
<li>The MyBB Group cannot be held liable for any damages caused by the software.</li>
<li>The original copyright must be retained.</li>
</ul>
<p>This change shouldn't mean much to many of our average users, and will require no changes in many cases. If you do have any concerns about any legal impact this may have upon you or your sites, please do open a thread in our <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">Private Inquiries</a> forum though we do not claim to be legal experts and a legal professional should be consulted if you have any real concerns.</p>
<p>We hope that this license change will make life a lot easier for users of both the MyBB software and our libraries.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>The recent <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2014/11/20/mybb-1-8-3-1-6-16-released-security-releases/">1.8.3 release</a> fixes a high risk SQL injection vulnerability, it is critically important that users upgrade as soon as possible to ensure their systems are safe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we wish to inform users that this vulnerability was used against the community forums in the days before it was discovered and patched by our team. The attack was successful in accessing our database, however our logs indicate that only a very small portion of the database was obtained. While we know the size of what was downloaded, we have no way of knowing what data it contained and therefore we cannot rule out that the attacker downloaded a small portion of the users table. The attacker also had access to the ACP for a short period.</p>
<p><strong>In light of this we recommend all community forum users take appropriate precautions on the assumption that their account was accessed. This includes changing your password and monitoring your account for any suspicious activity.</strong></p>
<p>Our understanding is that the attacker used the SQL injection to reset Chris' community forum password by retrieving the confirmation code, then discover the ACP directory name by searching PMs sent between team members. They were then able to edit the log settings in the ACP to write to a publicly accessible location and create a back-door script on the file-system. Upon discovering the attack we immediately took steps to prevent further access, and we are now confident that the system is secure having searched for any additional back-doors. We have also changed our ACP directory, adopted the new ACP PIN functionality added in 1.8, and used an isolated communication channel to distribute these new details to team members.</p>
<p>We'd like to reiterate that users running the latest version of MyBB are already secured against the vulnerabilities used to gain access to the ACP, and we'll be using information learned from this attack to further improve security within the ACP in future releases.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The MyBB Team.</p>

        <p><strong>UPDATE: Updated the page in which you should check for suspicious activity. It should be the Admin Logs page, not the Database Backups. You should also rebuild the cache (if you're on 1.8) for 'update_check'.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday, 14th of November, my (Pirata Nervo) GitHub account was compromised. By taking advantage of that, the attacker made a commit to our GH pages, more specifically one which is retrieved by the MyBB software in order to process version checks. Unfortunately, the attack allowed the attacker to setup Database backups of any MyBB forum, without exception, via JavaScript.</p>
<p>In order for you to know if you were attacked, you must have accessed the Admin CP of your forum from 14th November 23:00 GMT to 15th November 15:30 GMT. If you accessed your AdminCP during this timespan, i<strong>t is likely that you were attacked. Note that if you're on 1.8, the version check task may have been executed during this period, which may still allow the attack if you login after this period.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>To be sure about it, please log on to your AdminCP now and check your Database Backup Logs from <strong>ACP -&gt; Tools &amp; Maintenance -&gt; Administrator Logs</strong>. If there is at least one log for a database backup made between that time span mentioned above, <strong>you were affected</strong>. We strongly recommend you to alert your users about it so they can change their passwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you have to do: (in case you were attacked)</p>
<ul>
<li>Alert your users to change password.</li>
<li>Change your password.</li>
<li>Clear your cookies.</li>
<li>ACP -&gt; Tools &amp; Maintenance -&gt; Cache Manager -&gt; Rebuild Cache for 'update_check'.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already enabled 2 Factor Authentication on my GitHub account and changed my password. I deeply apologize for this event for it was never my intention to cause any harm to anyone but it should be my responsibility to keep my account as secure as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My apologies,</p>
<p>Pirata Nervo</p>

        <p>It's been a while since we announced the contributors group - we've had quite a few pages of discussion about it since then, some of us came up with ideas in order to promote it, and some came up with problems that would come out of those ideas. We've finally come to an agreement!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What is the Contributors Usergroup?</h4>
<p>This is the MyBB Group's recognition of your valued contributions to the project. We feel that the people in the Contributors usergroup are the main figures in the community that drive the project forward. Getting in is a matter of invitation not request and exceptions will not be made to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>I've done contributing but I haven't been added, what's going on?</h4>
<p>The MyBB Group assesses who we feel should be in the Contributor group on a per user basis. You may have had lots of Pull Requests merged or submitted plugins/themes to the Mods Site and not been added, this could be a mixture of reasons: 1) We've not got around to adding you; 2) We don't feel you have contributed enough given the quality of your Pull Requests; 3) We haven't noticed - we are all volunteers and some things slip through the net. If you feel strongly that you should be in this group then contact one of our Community Team members and they would be pleased to talk to you about the circumstances of you not being in the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>I was in the Contributors group but now I'm not, did I blink and miss something?</h4>
<p>Places in the Contributors group are for those that the MyBB group feels are active contributors towards the project. If you stop making good quality Pull Requests/plugins/themes or stop being involved in conversations after a good period of time, you may be removed at the discretion of the MyBB group. This group is in place so that the community can help MyBB evolve, if you're not doing this then you're not fulfilling the 'job description' of the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>You have a past of good development (Plugins, Pull Requests, Tutorials)</li>
<li>You submit five pull requests that are accepted to MyBB codebase.</li>
<li>You submit ten pull requests that are accepted to the docs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By meeting at least <strong>one</strong> of the requirements above you will be moved to the Contributors group - you'll have a badge next to your username on your profile and posts.</p>
<p><img src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/contributor.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Besides that, you'll be able to participate the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-171.html">1.8 Discussion forum</a> and at a later point, 2.0 Discussion.</p>
<p>If you do not meet any of the requirements yet we recommend you to look at our <a href="http://community.mybb.com/announcement-25.html">Workflow </a>and change that!</p>

        <p>With the release of MyBB 1.6.13, the team felt there was a need to address some issues that affect the future of the Project, the Community and the Team in general.</p>
<h4>Developers and MyBB Development Workflow</h4>
<p>With the departure of Nathan and Tomm, MyBB has once again found itself in need of active team members. This, along with the unavailability of most current developers due to time constraints caused by life issues, led to us breaking our workflow, which as you may have noticed ended up delaying the release of MyBB 1.6.13. After MyBB 1.6.13 was out, work on 1.8 Beta 1 has been resumed (and you can clearly see that by examining the commits made for on github in the 'feature' branch).</p>
<h4><strong>Moving forward with 2.0.</strong></h4>
<p>Initially 1.6 was supposed to lead to 2.0 directly, but with the team feeling that 2.0 was still in very early development, MyBB would lose to its competitors for quite a bit of time (the development time of 2.0). Thus, work was put into "modernizing" the look and feel of 1.6 before the complete rewrite, and so 1.8 was born. As anticipated, this has delayed work on 2.0 of course. Once 1.8 is released (Beta 1 is nearing its completion; at time of writing only one feature is left to finish: jQuery conversion; all the other open issues aimed for Beta 1 are bugs) work will start on 2.0. There has been a lot of talk of MyBB being a "<em>dead project"</em>, but this is very far from the truth. As an open source project, as long as we have active developers, the project will never be "<em>dead".</em> But we need the community's help - we've been helping you for a long time, we're asking you to help us now  - so if you feel that you know MyBB pretty well but most of all, if you feel that you have value to give to the team and project, contact us!</p>
<h4><strong>Changes that we are implementing now</strong></h4>
<p>It became apparent to us, that one of the major problems we have had was losing key team leaders. As you may remember, we recently <em>got rid of </em>the "Team Leader" role, and went with a more equal structure. This did not promote (as we had intended) productivity. So we have come up with a new system, whereby developers will take turns taking the "<em>lead" </em>on a per version basis. This will keep them all updated with the procedures required to package and release new versions. We are pleased to announce the <strong><a title="Stefan T. - I shall grant thee 1.6.14" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-2824.html" target="_blank">Stefan T</a></strong> will be assuming the role of Lead Developer first and and the next should be <a href="http://community.mybb.com/user-8582.html">Pirata Nervo</a> (after that a new internal poll will be made). We are also pleased to announce that <strong><a title="King Louis - King of SQA" href="http://community.mybb.com/user-57502.html" target="_blank">King Louis</a></strong> will be assuming the position of SQA team lead (the leader here doesn't change as we believe the SQA team requires a static leader).</p>
<h4><strong>Recruitment</strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, we are now looking for more active members for both Development, Support, and more importantly SQA (we're running low here!).  If you feel that you would be a good addition to the team, why not submit some pull requests on Github and/or drop an application to using the <strong><a title="Contact form" href="http://www.mybb.com/contact?subject=team-position" target="_blank">contact form</a>, </strong>posting a thread in <strong><a title="Post a thread in this forum that only YOU and US can see..." href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html" target="_blank">Private Inquiries</a> (recommended) </strong>or even by <em>PM'ing </em><a title="If I don't respond within 24 hours I will owe you a cookie." href="http://community.mybb.com/private.php?action=send&amp;uid=12694" target="_blank"><strong>us</strong></a>.  You cand read more about the responsibilities <strong><a title="Apply for the Team" href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply" target="_blank">here</a>. Do not be afraid of contacting us, we won't bite you - but we'll be always be honest with you.<br />

        <p><em>Disclaimer: look at the date this was posted</em></p>
<p>Following Facebook's acquisition of the Oculus Rift, the popular Virtual Reality headset crowdfunded by Kickstarter, officials from Facebook contacted us with a similar proposal: purchasing MyBB and developing it into a more full, fun, and professional project.  Today, we is pleased to announce that for $3.4 million, Facebook has acquired MyBB.</p>
<h4>What does this mean for MyBB?</h4>
<p>MyBB 1.8 will continue as scheduled, being the last of the 1.x series. It will have many new features integrated, such as chat, Facebook log in integration, etc. MyBB 2.0, however, will get an exciting new rewrite and a set release date of April 1, 2015.</p>
<h4>The new codebase</h4>
<p>What we're most excited about is the code. No longer hundreds of thousands of lines long, the MyBB code on your server will shrink down to a simple interface that pings Facebook's API to gather all the information needed. All forum data will be hosted on Facebook's servers, offering a secure and fast platform for the database.  Your forum's database will seamlessly upload during the upgrade from 1.8 -&gt; 2.0.  The code on your server will remain LGPL as in the 1.x series, combining with Facebook's server side code for a unique blend of open source and proprietary that will allow for the most modern, fast, and advanced social community software.</p>
<h4>Users &amp; Profiles</h4>
<p>Another thing we're excited for is user integration.  No longer will your users need to remember long, complex passwords, as they will be able to login and register via their Facebook account.  This will be the only login method, and your user's data will be merged with Facebook during the upgrade process.  The upgrade will auto-detect existing Facebook accounts based on email and merge them together.  The profile page on your MyBB install will pull information directly from Facebook!  No more is the need to upload avatars or change bios or locations, all will be integrated directly.</p>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<p>Because we'll be using Facebook accounts for your standard MyBB account, the opportunity for using Facebook's messaging system is wide open.  All members who have messaged each other on MyBB will automatically be made Facebook friends and will be able to carry out their discussion in the way so many members of the community have been asking for: conversation style.</p>
<h4>Forums &amp; Posts</h4>
<p>Posts will take on the style of a Facebook post, with replies appearing as comments.  This will allow us to utilize Facebook's comment history and like features.  Images will become the only form of attachments, and will display inline just like in a Facebook comment!</p>
<h4>Mobile Access</h4>
<p>This feature makes us especially happy: any MyBB forum will be accessible via the Facebook iOS or Android app!  There will be no more need for a mobile MyBB theme or plugin, as the Facebook app will handle it all.</p>
<h4>Additional Features</h4>
<p>Mass emails will no longer require a mail server, but will send as a group message via Facebook.  Facebook style notifications will also be on your forum, as well as the ability for members to create and moderate their own groups. Best of all, however, your new forum will be browsable by Oculus Rift.</p>
<p>We're excited as a team for this new opportunity and have more exciting announcements for you in the near future!</p>
<p>... April Fools!</p>

        <p>As we move closer to the first beta release of MyBB 1.8 the MyBB Team have been hard at work streamlining some of our behind-the-scenes services and workflows.</p>
<h4>Changes to Development</h4>
<p>A while ago we mentioned moving to a GitFlow workflow over at our GitHub repository. If you’re interested in helping us develop everyone’s favourite forum software take a <a title="MyBB Development Workflow" href="http://community.mybb.com/announcement-25.html" target="_blank">look at our new Development Workflow</a> and how you can get involved.</p>
<p>MyBB 1.6.x will now start using this workflow. MyBB 1.8.x will start using this when it reaches its first beta phase.</p>
<h4>Timed Releases</h4>
<p>With our new workflow the master branch in our repository should always be production ready. While only the latest release, available from MyBB.com, is supported on our support forums this allows us to provide set dates for bug fixes and maintenance releases.</p>
<p>You should see new MyBB releases every two months from January 2014 regardless of how many issues are resolved. So you can expect 1.6.13 in March ‘14, 1.6.14 in May ’14 and so on. There is no limit to how many versions we’ll have in the 1.6.x series until its EOL date.</p>
<p>Security releases remain unaffected and patches/releases are created whenever high risk vulnerabilities are reported and fixed.</p>
<h4>Reporting Bugs and Issues in MyBB 1.x</h4>
<p>One of the last remaining legacies of MyBB’s development cycles, Redmine, is now officially retired and no new members or issues can be created.</p>
<p>Instead, you can now report bugs and issues you find in MyBB in two ways: via the Community Forums (in the <a title="MyBB 1.6 Bugs &amp; Issues" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-126.html" target="_blank">1.6 Bugs &amp; Issues forum</a> or the <a title="MyBB 1.8 Bugs and Issues" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-157.html" target="_blank">1.8 Bugs &amp; Issues forum</a>) or directly at GitHub.</p>
<p>In the near future we’ll be moving all existing open issues to GitHub and archiving Redmine. At the moment existing users there can still comment and act on issues.</p>
<h4>Becoming a Contributor</h4>
<p>The MyBB Team will also be moving development discussions about the core into the open development sections on our Community Forums. To be able to start new threads and reply to these discussions you need to join our new Contributor group.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the <a title="Joining the Contributor Group" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-149160.html" target="_blank">Joining the Contributor Group</a> thread.</p>
<h4>Moving 1.8 to Beta</h4>
<p>Finally, we’re almost there. After almost 2 long years the MyBB Team have been busy finishing up the last remaining roadmap items for the first beta phase of MyBB 1.8.</p>
<p>Even at this exciting (and long overdue) stage there are still many tasks left to complete before you should be using 1.8 on your live forum.</p>
<p>Why not <a title="Download MyBB 1.7" href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-138326.html" target="_blank">download a copy of MyBB 1.7 today</a> and give it a test drive on your localhost – and <a title="MyBB 1.8 Suggestions &amp; Feedback" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-158.html" target="_blank">let us know what you think</a>!</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Every so often developments, changes, discussions and events occur that make even the most resilient users, team members and followers lose interest in our project. We, as a group, can only apologise for the miscommunication and missed chances to set things right.</p>
<p>We realise that with every step you take we need to be right beside you and not in the shadows pulling the strings. We need to learn from how you use our software, embrace the unique customisation of your forum and make it as easy as possible for you to see what we’re planning - and how you can help us accomplish that.</p>
<p>We understand that we need to be more open; this week, we’re taking the first steps to do that.</p>
<h4>Team Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>There will be one ‘MyBB Team’ usergroup to which all team members will belong to.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">This change is mainly for our internal processes only as there are a number of shared tasks and responsibilities across the group. Each member still belongs to a sub-group, such as Support or SQA, to which they’ll focus the bulk of their time. The member’s team will be visible by their usergroup badge and not username colour.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>There will be no application process or job vacancies for team member positions.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">Being more open will allow users and followers to discuss changes, make commits and write documentation without being a member of the team. We encourage anyone and everyone to help in all aspects of the project and, if they accept, can be invited to join the team for a more permanent group position and a pretty usergroup badge.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Members of the MyBB Team should be considered core workers who regularly contribute to the project.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">With open development forums we’ll be relying more on user contributions and interactions to move the project forward. The team will be there to help and guide you through the hoops whether you’re a beginner or an expert.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Forum Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’re reorganising Support forums to help provide the quickest service possible.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">A new Installation and Upgrade Support forum is being created to help users who are struggling to get their forum going. General Support, Security Management and Support, Merge System Support and International Support will also be a part of this category.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re moving International Support to 3rd party sites for users to get help in their native language.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">MyBB has a large non-English following and we struggle to support these users. By providing easy access to the best support forum in their native language they’ll benefit from their local community. International Support will be closed to posting and have only one thread per language – which will include language pack addons for the language and a list of support forums available.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re making an official repository for language packs.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">The mybb-translations repository on GitHub will hold all official language pack addons for MyBB and we hope translators will move to this model. They’ll be able to get support from other members of their community to help translate MyBB into their language. Greater communication with translators will help have packs ready for new releases.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re centralising the Resources forums to provide a one-stop place for modifications.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">The Resources section on our forum will change to include Plugins, Themes, Translations, Third Party Integrations, MyCodes and Tutorials. Sub-forums in these categories will provide Releases, Support, Development and Requests threads.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>We’re removing the Requests/Services/Jobs forum.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">This area has been a near constant thorn for team members and moderation and, by redirecting users to the Resources forums (for plugins/themes/logos) or Web Development forum (for domains and general help), we’ll have more time to concentrate on our project.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Being a part of the MyBB Team is a privilege, not a hindrance.</strong>
<div style="margin:15px 0;">
<p>While we actively promote user contributions we expect all members of the community to rightfully respect team members, who are dedicating their time to help.</p>
<p>Personal attacks, trolling and disrespect is not acceptable anywhere; whether on a forum or workplace; and it will not be tolerated. Past history and rules have cultured a group whose sole intention is to disrupt, disengage and challenge and this has to change.</p>
<p>We feel those who are responsible for this change know who they are. We want the MyBB community to be friendly, mature, creative and open. If users of the community can’t do this new forum permissions can restrict them from certain areas and, ultimately, a permanent ban will be issued.</p>
<p>No users, regardless of length of membership, status in the community or reputation, are immune to this.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Development</h4>
<ul>
<li>There will be new development forums for MyBB 1.6, MyBB 1.8 and MyBB 2.0. These include Discussion, Bugs and Issues, and Suggestions and Feedback.</li>
<li>While these will be available for everyone only members of the new Contributors group will be able to post in the Discussion forum. This usergroup can be joined via your User CP and is exclusively for people who contribute to the project (via making resources, tutorials, guides etc. or interacting on GitHub).</li>
<li>We’ll be turning off new issues on Redmine, our development site, and moving bug reporting to the forums. Once confirmed these bugs will be reported automatically on GitHub by a team member. While we would prefer users to follow this to be able to discuss bugs and reproduction, we won’t reject issues posted directly on GitHub if you prefer that method.</li>
<li>We’ll be moving to a GitFlow workflow for our main repository.</li>
<li>We'll be running scheduled releases so that you can expect regular updates for your forum (this won't affect security releases).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>These changes are all about cleaning up, refreshing and changing the way the MyBB project works to focus on our primary aim – to make great forum software – and for others to help us do that.</p>
<p>We’ll be making most of these changes this Friday, 1st November. Development changes will happen at a later date and more information will be available soon.</p>
<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
<p>The prospect of a Q&amp;A has been openly suggested quite a few times and I’m pleased to say that, alongside these changes, several team members and I will be available this weekend to take your questions. Look out for a thread in the Community and on Twitter for more details of this.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
<p>MyBB Team</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>MyBB 1.8 is the next minor release for the 1.x series. The aim of this release is to introduce a level of standardisation and organisation that MyBB has previously lacked and to bring the series into line with other products and services that we hope to bring to you in the near future.</p>
<p>1.8 is a huge leap forward for the 1.x series. It will introduce some powerful new features while also providing a stable forum solution for your community for years to come. It will also allow us, the MyBB Group, to focus on the next generation of our software - the anticipated 2.x series.</p>
<h4>Status</h4>
<p>Due to the extended development and testing phase of 1.6.10, as well as the usual lull in activity due to workload, exams and holidays, MyBB 1.8 isn’t as far along its roadmap as we would like. Naturally we are disappointed but we remain committed to creating and providing one of the most advanced free forum software packages available.</p>
<p>Further to this we are, as a group, undergoing huge changes to how we work to help make releases quicker. These past 12 months has seen an insane amount of work completed by our team, much of which is behind-the-scenes, and we hope to bring news of this to you very soon.</p>
<p>With updates in mind, you can now find the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-138326.html" target="_blank"><strong>MyBB 1.8 Roadmap on our community forums</strong></a>. This thread will be kept up to date with the latest news, features and bug fixes that are happening during its development.</p>
<h4>Release Date</h4>
<p>As always, MyBB 1.8 will be released when we feel it is ready. We opened our GitHub project to the public so that anyone - not just the MyBB Team - can help with development of the 1.x series. Even if you can’t code, anyone can download both branches (1.6 &amp; 1.8) to help test bugs and offer suggestions for improvements. Alongside our roadmap you can keep up to date with the project and see what is coming next.</p>
<p>1.8 is not feature locked at this moment in time. However, we don’t plan on introducing further major overhauls to help avoid plugin and theme incompatibilities. </p>
<h4>Joining the Team</h4>
<p>There has never been a more exciting time in MyBB’s history; with 1.6 ready for new technologies, 1.8 on the way and starting 2.x soon (which is looking absolutely awesome) 2013 is already proving to be a busy year. If you feel you have got what it takes to be a dedicated volunteer for the project we’d love to have you on the team!</p>
<p>We’re currently looking for developers for the 1.x series, SQA team members and members for our new Resources Team - who will be focused on managing our community services. If you are interested in any of these PM a staff member, post an application in our <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html">Private Inquiries forum</a> or <a href="http://www.mybb.com/contact">send us an email</a>.</p>

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2013/01/23/getting-involved-mybb-github-now-available/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">23 Jan 2013</span></a></p>
    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Back in June 2012, after our <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2012/06/03/access-to-community-forums-restored-modifications-site-underway-updates-faq/" target="_blank">MyBB.com domain was hijacked</a>, we removed public access to our development repositories and moved to GitHub.</p>
<p>Today we are pleased to announce that our main repository, where the 1.x series is developed, is now available to the public!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mybb/mybb" target="_blank"><strong>Visit the MyBB repository on GitHub →</strong></a></p>
<h4>The Basics</h4>
<p>The <em>mybb</em> repository consists of 3 main branches: Master, Stable and Feature. These branches contain a different set of code depending on the name of the branch.</p>
<p>At the moment of writing this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master</strong> contains code that has been (or is to be) publically released (currently 1.6.9)</li>
<li><strong>Stable</strong> contains work and bug fixes for the next minor version of MyBB (so 1.6.10, 1.6.11 etc)</li>
<li><strong>Feature</strong> contains all our work on the next feature version of MyBB - 1.8</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that, although all this work is available to you, MyBB only officially supports the latest release. Stable and Feature code may contain partially-committed features which are broken, incomplete or may never make it to public release and for these reasons we do not recommend using either of these branches on your own forums.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;"><strong>They will NOT be supported by the Support Team.</strong></span></p>
<h4>For Developers</h4>
<p>Access to our repository provides plugin and theme developers the opportunity to work with the latest code. We hope members of our community, and those interested in our project, become more closely involved with MyBB’s development.</p>
<p>Cutting edge development is designed for advanced users only. While we will try and support you with your work MyBB can’t provide support for Git or GitHub. We’re working on improving our documentation about development.</p>
<h4>About MyBB 1.8 Alpha</h4>
<p>With the opening of our repository MyBB 1.8 is now publically available via the Feature branch. Please note that this only contains a handful of optimizations, features and changes that we are going to implement into this series.</p>
<p>Major features, such as the Report Centre, Spam Centre and our jQuery conversion are just starting to be worked on but accessing 1.8 should, however, give you an idea of the direction we’re heading in and what we’re trying to achieve with this version of MyBB. It should also allow developers to keep on track with what changes we’re making and, with that in mind, we do encourage anyone interested in working with 1.8 to get involved or get in touch via the 1.8 sections on our forum (coming soon).</p>
<h4>Getting Involved</h4>
<p>To get involved with MyBB development you will first need a GitHub account. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the repository</li>
<li>If you want to fix a bug - switch to the <em>stable</em> branch</li>
<li>If you want to work with 1.8 - switch to the <em>feature</em> branch</li>
<li>Make your changes (ensuring you follow the MyBB Development Standards) and push them to your forked repository</li>
<li>Send us a <a title="Sending Pull Requests" href="https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/" target="_blank">pull request</a> via GitHub with your changes and make sure you reference the issue ticket number your changes relate to (update the ticket too to tell us you’ve fixed it)</li>
<li>SQA will provide feedback and, if it passes verification, your changes are merged into MyBB</li>
</ul>
<h4>GitHub Issues to replace Redmine</h4>
<p>At the moment MyBB uses Redmine to <a href="http://dev.mybb.com" target="_blank">power our issue tracker</a>. Over time, we will be migrating to use GitHub’s inbuilt Issues tracker to provide closer integration between the repository and reported issues. It should also create a one-point resource for all development.</p>
<p>We’re starting this migration with MyBB 1.8. If you find a bug or problem within the feature branch you should first report it in the MyBB 1.8 Bugs &amp; Issues forum. This allows members of the community to discuss the issue and confirm that it is, in fact, a bug. Once confirmed, a member of the MyBB Team will use a clever custom plugin (developed by Nathan Malcolm) to move the issue to GitHub for developers to work on a fix.</p>
<p>The new workflow eliminates the need for a separate account on Redmine and should allow more members to contribute towards development.</p>
<p>The MyBB 1.8 sections on the Community Forum will be available soon. In the mean time, please use the <a title="Suggestions &amp; Feedback" href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-7.html" target="_blank">MyBB 1.6/1.8 Suggestions &amp; Feedback</a> forum.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>There is a lot of new information here but it’s just the start of a new journey for MyBB and our community. By improving reporting methods, making it possible for non-team members to contribute and continuing to work on our new series we feel confident that MyBB will continue to be the best free forum software for years to come.</p>
<p>With thanks,</p>
<p>The MyBB Team</p>

    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>As MyBB approaches its 10th-year anniversary it's quite easy for us to dwell on history. Even with the changes we're working on in MyBB 1.8 you can still compare the early versions of our product to our next major release and see that they are made from the same group of people. Despite the dozens of Developers, SQA Testers, Support Team members, PR guys and Management we've had over this time, who have each made their mark in their own way, the consistency of MyBB as a forum system at its core is one of the fundamental mantras of the MyBB Group.</p>
<p>With that in mind, whenever we do come to develop around a feature, we're cautious to remove the legacy it might leave behind. It is often a tough decision between moving forward and embracing something new and doing what we know. MyBB 1.8 gives us a great chance to look around and research how to improve these features for our users; with around 40 planned research projects into different areas of MyBB we're aiming to bring a higher level of usability and functionality to your forum.</p>
<h4>Avatar Changes</h4>
<p>With <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>, an avatar hosting service, being integrated into Wordpress, Redmine and GitHub (alongside other websites and many 3rd party addons for other software) it brings together an opportunity for us to provide a consistent platform for users to have the same look wherever they go. In MyBB 1.8 you can now use your Gravatar email in the Avatar URL field. Options in the ACP allow Administrators to control the content of avatars with Gravatar's age-based rating systems.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1925" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/g548rw.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1925" title="Changing Avatar" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/g548rw.png?w=300" alt="Changing Avatar" width="300" height="101" /></a> The MyBB 1.8 Change Avatar[/caption]</p>
<p>Alongside Gravatar is our new format_avatar function. This introduces the ability to pass a user's avatar information to a single function to work out the correct dimensions to display on the page; it also means we aren't parsing the same avatar twice for the same user on the same page. If the user has no avatar set Administrators are able to set a default avatar from the ACP to use instead.</p>
<p>These changes do come with some sad news; in MyBB 1.8, we've removed the avatar gallery feature. We'll all be disappointed to see the end of Supertux and Mr Spam but we thought it best to keep a clear and simple method to change user avatars in which the avatar gallery was a much non-used feature to the majority of forums.</p>
<h4>News and Version Check Changes</h4>
<p>One of the main aims of MyBB 1.8 is to help improve the services we offer to our own users. This involves keeping users up to date about what's happening and new versions of MyBB.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1926" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/bb8fc.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1926" title="News Feed in the ACP" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/bb8fc.png?w=300" alt="News Feed in the ACP" width="300" height="157" /></a> News Feed in the ACP[/caption]</p>
<p>In the ACP, we've introduced a small news feed into the Dashboard. We've also moved the Version Check, which used to have its own section, into the Dashboard too so that all updates are in the same place right in front of administrators. A new task is to be added to regularly check for any updates (versions and news) rather than relying on users to catch the 'Your last version check was...' message that may otherwise be easily missed.</p>
<h4>The Little Things</h4>
<p>Some of the other, smaller changes to MyBB 1.8 come to fix those trivial things people may (or may not) have noticed. These include removing the option to rate your own thread and changing trim() in templates to rtrim() so that those with OCD can create pretty source code for their themes.</p>
<p>We're also looking to provide public access to our GitHub repositories in the very near future where a few problems have stopped us from doing so sooner. As soon as the MyBB 1.8 theme changes are ready we'll also be making that project available too - alongside development standards for non-team members for those who want to get involved in helping us create the best free forum software.</p>
<h4>Changes on the Team</h4>
<p>Many will have noticed some changes on the team recently. We've welcomed back on-board Polarbear541 to our SQA Team and StefanT and Nathan Malcolm have moved over from SQA to the Development Team. All have quickly jumped into their new roles and we're looking forward to their contributions.</p>
<h4>Joining the Team</h4>
<p>Being apart of the MyBB family and developing the future of forum software is no small task. Being volunteers takes dedication and patience as well as the skills to pull off your role. Take a look at <a title="Join the Team" href="http://www.mybb.com/about/apply" target="_blank">Joining the Team</a>, and if you meet the descriptions, send us an application – we’d love to have you on the Team!</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>You've been hearing this for months, if not years by now: the new Mods site is coming soon.<br />
That was in fact, always true. However, the person who was working on it had to leave the team last year and left us his work.<br />
Since I offered myself to do the Mods site, I decided to start from scratch and create a plugin instead of a separate website - that would make integration much easier.<br />
I started back in October 2011 and by now the Mods site is almost fully operational - apart from the Plugin Translations feature and a few final touches, everything is done! It has been tested thoroughly by me and the rest of the team and even though it's not perfect, it does what we wanted to just fine.</p>
<p>Now let's get to what's really important: what's changed? how does it work? what's new?<br />
The entire Mods site is now based on a single word: collaboration.<br />
You will now be able to have people working on the same project as you, contributing to it, discussing it...in one single place.</p>
<p>Major features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Control Panel</li>
<li>Builds</li>
<li>Bug Tracker</li>
<li>Suggestions</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-project-page-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1911" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW PROJECT PAGE 2" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-project-page-2.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="90" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-project-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1906" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW PROJECT PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-project-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="87" /></a><br />
<strong>Collaboration</strong><br />
When you create a project (no matter what kind of project is - a plugin, graphic, whatever) you will be considered the author of that project.<br />
As the author, you can invite other people to become collaborators of your project and help you with it - being it as a tester, developer or anything else.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-manage-collaborators.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1909" title="SCREENSHOT OF MANAGE COLLABORATORS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-manage-collaborators.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Control Panel</strong><br />
The Control Panel is the place where you can view what's going on over the projects you work on and of course, manage invitations from other users.<br />
Another feature of the Control Panel is the one that lets you create a project (for obvious reasons, this is the most important one).<br />
When you create a project you are required to submit an initial build and that project will be set for "Awaiting Approval" unless you are considered an "Approved Developer".<br />
An "Approved Developer" is someone we think has gained enough confidence from us to believe that any project created by that person is safe for the end user.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-control-panel.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1905" title="SCREENSHOT OF CONTROL PANEL" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-control-panel.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="93" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Builds</strong><br />
Every project is now built around builds. That is, whenever you want to upload a new change you just submit a new build (a ZIP containing the latest data).<br />
That build is automatically considered "dev" and can be downloaded by anyone. When you think you've reached a stable status, you can switch (requires approval) to "stable".<br />
The latest stable build is the one that appears on the download page - don't worry, you can browse a list of builds and download any.<br />
Builds may only be submitted by the author and its collaborators.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-download-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1907" title="SCREENSHOT OF DOWNLOAD PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-download-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="83" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-manage-builds.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1908" title="SCREENSHOT OF MANAGE BUILDS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-manage-builds.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="109" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-all-builds.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1902" title="SCREENSHOT OF ALL BUILDS" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-all-builds.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="67" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Bug Tracker</strong><br />
Is there a better way to have a stable project than having a bug tracker built-in with the new system? We thought one would be very important and decided to implement it.<br />
You can decide if it's private (author only) and if collaborators can access it or not or even give access to certain users who are not direct collaborators.<br />
If you don't agree with us and don't like bug trackers or have a bug tracker somewhere else, you can even link to that one if you wish and disable the default one.</p>
<p>The way the bug tracker works is similar to the way Redmine works so if you're used to work with Redmine you will not find strange to work with this one - but of course, don't expect it to be thaaaaaat powerful, I only have got two hands!</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-bug-tracker-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1903" title="SCREENSHOT OF BUG TRACKER #1" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-bug-tracker-1.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="105" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Suggestions</strong><br />
Receiving feedback from users is very important if you want to create amazing software. Because of that, we decided to implement a Suggestions page in which users can give suggestions for your project.<br />
If you don't like it, feel free to disable it, it's all up to you!</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-suggestions-page.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1910" title="SCREENSHOT OF SUGGESTIONS PAGE" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-suggestions-page.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="76" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screenshot-of-view-suggestion.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1901" title="SCREENSHOT OF VIEW SUGGESTION" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/screenshot-of-view-suggestion.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="81" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong><br />
Besides those major features, the Mods site also contains a few others which make it even better:<br />
* Previews - you can now manage your project preview images in a much better way than before.<br />
* Translations – plugin projects are the only ones who have got translations and can be easily managed by collaborators – only they can submit translations.<br />
* Change Log - whenever you submit a new build, you are required to enter a change log. The change log of the project is the combination of every build's change log.<br />
* Recommended - we got rid of the project ratings. You can recommend projects but not give any rating.<br />
* Statistics - this page shows you relevant information about the most downloaded projects as well as the most recommended ones.<br />
* Mod CP - Projects and Builds can be easily managed from the Mod CP which speeds up the approval process.<br />
* Whenever an update is awaiting approval, users can still download the latest stable (or any other) build without problems.<br />
* If the project hasn't been updated for more than 6 months, you will see that information when viewing the project page.<br />
* Support - a new link has been added to the project page which links to the Plugin Support forum on the MyBB Community. However, project authors can change that link to their site's URL if they wish.<br />
* Optionally, users may enter their PayPal email address which will result in a Donate button being shown on the project page.</p>
<p>We hope you are still excited about it. We are too. We really want to push this live as soon as possible but as you know, we all do this on our free time. One thing is certain though: we want to release this at the same time as MyBB 1.8 (or perhaps sooner!).</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2012/07/12/mybb-1-8-tour-july-update/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">12 Jul 2012</span></a></p>
    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>Since we announced MyBB 1.8 back in April work towards making a public beta has been slow. This time of year is traditionally the busiest for the team members with exams, workloads and personal projects – not to the mention most of us enjoying the summer (or lack of, in some cases!) – often taking over from our usual MyBB duties. Where we were once working on the code every day there has been weeks without anything being done at all. This is, unfortunately, the perils of volunteer work.</p>
<p>We know you're all just as excited about MyBB 1.8 as we are, and we haven't told you everything that is changing yet, so we're stepping it up a gear to put it all together as fast as we can without compromising our new features. We've tried setting deadlines (and failing miserably) and I know you're sick of the usual ready-when-it's-ready story so all I can say is please bear with us. We'll be working hard to bring you this feature update and that starts with our move to GitHub.</p>
<h4>Git Migration</h4>
<p>Part of the fallout from when MyBB.com was partly taken over was to have an overview look at how we do things behind the scenes to see if we could improve our services. This understandably has a knock-on effect on our development; we decided it was best to drop SVN and move to GitHub ahead of the 1.8 schedule. MyBB 1.6 development also happens over there too.</p>
<p>We've briefly hidden the 1.6 repository so that our team can get used to this new service and for us to sort out some new standards for developers and contributors to follow. This is a pretty big change not only for users but for our team as well so we need to take some time to get used to it too.</p>
<p>That being said, we haven't quite got rid of everything. We will still be using the development site - powered by Redmine - as the central place to report bugs and issues with MyBB and the Merge System. It is up and running but we are having a few problems syncing the repository on GitHub and our local copy here. We hope to have this - and the GitHub project - up and running soon.</p>
<h4>Consistency in 1.8</h4>
<p>A general trait that has been hanging over 1.8 during planning and early development is consistency; making sure everything we do looks and feels the same as though it is from the same product, system and service. Everything from MyBB.com to the install process on your own forums will be getting a makeover to the new upgraded style giving MyBB in general a clean modern look. We've replaced the popular FamFamFam icons with the equally popular Fugue icon set to give 1.8's UX (user experience) a fresh appeal - meaning 1.8 uses CSS buttons and carries PNG icons instead of GIFs. We're looking into providing sprite images too for the ever-conscious large forum owner as well as providing theme artists a new opportunity with this style of coding.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1889" align="aligncenter" width="670"]<a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/1800_update-21.png" target="_blank"><img class=" wp-image-1889   " title="1.8 Installer and Postbit" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/1800_update-21.png" alt="1.8 Installer and Postbit" width="670" height="254" /></a> 1.8 Installer and Postbit[/caption]</p>
<p>Alongside the jQuery update and base colours, 1.8 themes are sure to be some of the best in the series.</p>
<h4>Full Feature Update</h4>
<p>So, as you might have thought by now, MyBB 1.8 is going to be a bigger update than most people imagined. While not 2.0-esque, it will certainly provide a full feature update that will require careful planning and action. And, to settle the nerves of the plugin developers, there will be no major updates to the plugin system - meaning for the majority only the compatibility section of your plugins will need updated for them work in 1.8.</p>
<p>By providing an update like this we hope to extend the life of the 1.x series while also providing the tools and processes for developers to create even more amazing themes and plugins. It also gives us, as a team, a chance to rebalance our own structure to provide a better product for you all to enjoy.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>As most of you who will be reading this are aware, three days ago (beginning the 31st of May) the MyBB.com domain (along with our other domains) were hijacked by a group of hackers (we're not going to identify them by name but they have been very vocal in claiming responsibility so you should have no problem finding them if you're so inclined). They also tried to access our server and many other services we use.</p>
<p>At this stage we have access to all our systems back and are in the process of restoring services, however we're pleased to say that we are also taking this opportunity to retool components of our website and upgrade our server infrastructure.</p>
<p>This blog post will probably be the first of many, but we'll endeavor to keep you updated as much as possible regarding progress. At this stage we don't expect all services to be online for at least a week while the new servers are configured and we prepare new components of our website, however this blog is obviously already online and the MyBB home page will be up very soon too.</p>
<h3>The story to date</h3>
<p>There are still a few missing pieces, but at this stage we have a pretty clear understanding of what happened. Contrary to what has been posted elsewhere, we do not believe social engineering was the culprit, although the hackers did try unsuccessfully to gain access to several of our accounts via this method.</p>
<p>The main incident that lead to the breach was a compromise of Chris' personal Apple ID (iCloud, etc) account. From there, the hackers were able to reset passwords to our hosting and domain accounts. It's still not clear how they got access to this account, however they also had numerous personal details about Chris, including contact details and knowledge of at least the last four numbers of his primary credit card.</p>
<p>Fortunately SoftLayer (our host) called Chris when his password was reset which alerted us to the situation unfolding and all public access to the server was shut off soon thereafter. <strong>As far we can tell they were not able to log into our server and do not have copies of our databases.</strong> We have been very pleased by the response we received from SoftLayer and without their vigilance the situation could have been far worse.</p>
<p>While Chris was trying to reset his passwords to NameCheap (our Domain Registrar at the time) and Apple ID accounts, the hackers even went as far as to remote wipe his iPhone via iCloud to prevent him from having 3G access. Unfortunately they successfully took control of Chris's NameCheap account and redirected the domain to their defacement page, later we discovered they even tried to transfer the domain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we did not get the expedited response from NameCheap that we would have hoped for given the severity of the situation, and it was about six hours before we got access to our account back. As a result we have already transferred MyBB.com to another domain registrar with better controls around account security.</p>
<p>Since then we have been planning the recovery effort, including taking the opportunity to improve our infrastructure.  We will be moving to a new server setup, but given our security scare a few months ago we are also auditing the site software we use and only moving what we know is clean to the new server. More details on changes to the site are detailed further down this article.</p>
<p>With regard to why we were targeted, frankly we are baffled by the logic. The group identified MyBB as being targeted because one of our user's runs an online forum dedicated to hacking. <strong>By this same analogy, if someone purchases a car and then uses it to run someone down or damage another's property, then the manufacturer of the car should be responsible, which is obviously corrupted logic.</strong></p>
<p>The group totes freedom as their cause but by attacking an Open Source project they are undermining freedom in every sense of the word. <strong>Anyone is free to download and use our software, no matter if you're rich or poor, a nurse or a hacker</strong>, and the fact they targeted us for this is an utter contradiction of their reasoning.</p>
<p>As many MyBB users will know, we don't even offer support on our community forums to hacking sites, and there are no exceptions. We can only conclude that attention and notoriety are their true motivations, and that their sense of ethics is a disgrace to the online community. We sincerely hope the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>
<h3>What we're doing</h3>
<p>First and foremost we have adopted two factor authentication wherever possible. As mentioned above, the domain names have already been transferred to a registrar offering two factor authentication, among other security features. We'll also be adopting two factor authentication on our new servers, and to various internal services. The new servers should improve performance of our website, and CloudFlare has also been setup.</p>
<p>As you might have also noticed, this blog has already been moved from being a locally hosted WordPress installation to being hosted on WordPress.com, which should ensure it is accessible even when our servers are down. We are hoping to make a similar change to the wiki before services are fully restored and as previously announced, development will be moving to GitHub with 1.8. Our goal with moving services offsite is to improve availability, improve maintainability, reduce load on our servers and improve security.</p>
<p>Finally,  although our website infrastructure did not contribute to the intrusion, we are reviewing the security of all our services prior to moving them to our new server to ensure our systems are as secure as they could be.</p>
<p>We thank everyone for their continued patience and support over this difficult time and hope to have everything back online soon.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chris, Tim, and the rest of the MyBB Team</p>

        <p class="block__heading__subtitle"><a href="https://blog.mybb.com/blog.mybb.com/2012/04/03/mybb-1-8-tour-introduction/" class="block__heading__subtitle__link blog-post__permalink"><span class="blog-post__date">03 Apr 2012</span></a></p>
    </header>
    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>On April 1st we announced a 1.6.7 Update which updated both MyBB and the Merge System. If you haven't seen this or not upgraded yet please make sure you read the <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2012/04/01/mybb-1-6-7-update-1-8-development/" target="_blank">MyBB and Merge System 1.6.7 Release blog post</a>. We also announced our plans for MyBB 1.8; it was no April Fool.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, just under 2 years ago, we released MyBB 1.6 which introduced over 40 new features - some more at home in commercial software. As MyBB's popularity continues to grow, the rise of social networks, rival software and the greater expectations of users old and new gives us some of the hardest challenges we've faced; to stay on top, to deliver a brilliant product and provide it to you for free.</p>
<p>With our development roadmap for MyBB 2.0 getting underway soon, we quickly felt the need to bridge the large gap that would have been 1.6 to 2.0. We wanted to create something that would provide a legacy to users of the 1.x series - the best of the best - and there was only one way we could get that to our users; MyBB 1.8.</p>
<h3>What You Can Expect From 1.8</h3>
<p>Whereas 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6 delivered over 100 new features 1.8 aims to be more of a subtle upgrade, a facelift and a move to more open source development so that others too can help create the best free forum software. We'll of course be providing the usual bug fixes and working with large forum owners to see if we can help further improve performance and stability. MyBB 1.8 is a perfect chance for us to provide changes that we couldn't typically do within our maintenance cycles.</p>
<h4>A New Look</h4>
<p>When we announced our new logo and mascot, Bolt, the Team soon realised that we didn't want to wait until 2.0 was released to use them. The 1.6 default theme made these look out of place in its dated design (which was last updated in 2008) so we needed something more up to date. Justin, our lead designer, who created the Apart theme series (from which many MyBB communities either use or have customised the look for themselves) has worked on developing the series for the new 1.8 default theme. We worked together to figure out a method for enabling the Apart colours to be included by default but without the need for including 14 separate themes before the administrator even opened their forum. This method is what we call <strong>attachable base colours</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/apart-1800-overview.png" target="_blank"><img class="teaser_illustration" title="The new default theme for MyBB 1.8" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/apart-1800-overview.png" alt="The new default theme for MyBB 1.8" width="670" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>These changes to the theme system allow you to create colours to which you can attach stylesheets (just like you can attach stylesheets to pages). You can also set a display order for all your stylesheets so that they can override styles. Together, the changes mean you can add a theme with as many custom colours as you want. Using the parent/child theme structure that already exists in 1.x you can restrict or allow certain usergroups to use these colours and, as they inherit the main stylesheets, they're very easy to manage. So, there is no longer the need to install a dozen different themes just for a different colour header.</p>
<h4>A New Look Admin Control Panel (ACP)</h4>
<p>Along with the new default theme there needs to be a new look Admin Control Panel (ACP). Our ACP is regarded as one of the easiest to use; it's friendly and we didn't want to change it much. Instead, we gave it a similar Apart makeover to our front-end.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogdotmybbdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/acp-1800-overview.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="teaser_illustration" title="Screenshot of the MyBB 1.8 ACP" src="/blog.mybb.com/assets/images/acp-1800-overview.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the MyBB 1.8 ACP" width="670" height="379" /></a></p>
<p>Please note that along with the default theme the look may change as development continues.</p>
<h4>Powered by jQuery</h4>
<p>While 1.8 won't be able to make your cocoa or project your forum's logo onto the moon, much to our disappointment, we really weren't pulling a prank on this one; MyBB 1.8 will be powered by jQuery. The lighter and more powerful JavaScript library should be able to extend what both Theme Artists and Plugin Developers are able to do without causing conflicts or heavy loading pages. Both front-end and back-end will use the library. This change is probably the most destructive for themes and plugins in the 1.8 upgrade and we'll be providing support throughout its beta period ready for a main release. In total, including the changes to the default theme, about 20 templates require updating from 1.6.</p>
<p>Along with jQuery comes a change in post editor. Although I've had my eye on an 'off the shelf' editor for quite some time we've yet to make a decision on whether we write our own or not; we'll be covering that in a future tour. However, please don't suggest which editor to use as our aim is to make it interchangeable so you can use your favourite one.</p>
<h4>Trash Can</h4>
<p>One of the most requested features for MyBB is a trash can - or as I prefer, the ability to recover deleted posts. In 1.8, you'll be able to decide if a user's deleted post is obliterated forever or is recoverable via the Mod CP. Global and usergroup permissions will allow this to be controlled across your users.</p>
<h4>Spam Improvements</h4>
<p>For those of you waiting for Spam Ninja I'm very sorry to disappoint as I did promise it to you last year. As soon as 1.8 was decided, I stopped developing it as a plugin and started integrating relevant parts into the core instead. We'll be looking to improve spam prevention and detection in 1.8 which we'll cover in a future tour.</p>
<h4>Upgrading to 1.8</h4>
<p>Upgrading to 1.8 will be similar to upgrading from 1.4 to 1.6; many plugins will only need to change their compatibility line and will only need some major changes if they use Prototype JavaScript, use login functions or make large theme changes. Throughout the beta period, we'll be upgrading the Wiki with new information and providing support to plugin developers to help them with their new plugins.</p>
<h4>Github</h4>
<p>The Team has been trying to plan a move away from our current SVN setup to the popular social coding site Github for some time. We've come up against problems but feel confident that now is the time to open up our development to people outside of the MyBB Team. Github can be an extremely powerful tool for development and it is something we're eager to do - we have been working on 1.8 in secret in one of our repositories there which will be made available after our first beta release.</p>
<p>We've gone outside of our usual box with 1.8 in that we're actually telling you what we're doing and what we're planning even though none of this is public. We're aiming to provide a beta of 1.8 in May so please be patient while we're polishing our development and removing all the takeaways and soft drink cans.</p>
<h3>Wrap</h3>
<p>With MyBB 1.8, our aim is to fully complete the series with features and improvements that make us a better rival not only to our free forum software friends but also to commercial community software too. We want to make it more friendly, faster and go further than any of our products have been before. Everyone here at MyBB is looking forward to 1.8 and hope you are too!</p>
<p>See you at the next tour!</p>
<p>Tomm</p>

        <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>We'd like to inform you that two security holes were found in two plugins which are very common on multiple MyBB forums out there. The affected plugins are the following:</p>
<p>[ SEO ] Simple Tag Cloud Plugin (Tags) by Watt<br />
FBConnect (not available on our Mods site) by Nayar</p>
<p>The first was unapproved and a PM was sent to the plugin author and until the author fixes the issue it will remain unapproved on the Mods site.<br />
The second has been updated already and the issue has been fixed. If you're looking for the fixed version, it is available on the author's website as well as on the MyBB community forums <a href="http://community.mybb.com/thread-111008.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly advise you to remove the first plugin entirely from your forum and either remove the second one or install the fixed version.<br />
We also recommend you to do the necessary searching for any data that may have been compromised.</p>
<p>On a side note, numerous "exploiting scripts" have been spreading throughout the internet which refer to these two vulnerabilities as if they were vulnerabilities in MyBB itself and that is not true.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
MyBB Team</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>When 1.6.4 was announced almost 3 months ago it was one of the biggest updates MyBB has ever released. It fixed over 100 issues and brought performance improvements for MyBB forums - large or small - across the world. It was also popular for people who were new to MyBB - starting their project for the first time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 1.6.4 release files were contaminated by code that was not meant to be there and could open a security vulnerability on your forum. It only affects those that are running 1.6.4.</p>
<p>We advise that you fix the problem as soon as you can. You can do so by following these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://www.mybb.com/download/latest" target="_blank">latest release of MyBB</a>.</li>
<li>Replace ./index.php (in the root folder of your forum) with the one in the download (./Upload/index.php).</li>
<li>Remove the ./install/ folder</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and follow the <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mybb_1604_patches.txt">1.6.4 Patch Instructions</a></li>
<li>If you are unable to find the affected areas, this issue does not affect you. Otherwise, remove the ./install/ folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any problems, please report them in the <a href="http://community.mybb.com/forum-127.html">General Support Forum</a> on the Community. If you have renamed 'index.php', for example if you're using the portal as your homepage, please remember to update the correct file accordingly.</p>
<p>We discovered the extent of this problem earlier today but with the release of MyBB 1.6.5 still being a few weeks away, forums need to be patched to protect against any vulnerabilities. We're still investigating how our release became contaminated and if we find anything else in the mean time, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<h4><strong>Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities</strong></h4>
<p>If you think you've found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we've had time to prepare and release a patch.</p>
<p>As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the <a href="http://www.mybb.com/contact/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
MyBB Team</p>

        <p>The MyBB Group has had an IRC channel for several years hosted on irc.msgplus.net but it hasn't been widely publicized for a long time and is only regularly used by a small number of people.  Today we're announcing something of a relaunch for the official MyBB IRC channel and with it our move to the <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a> network.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the move has to do with the fact that MyBB is now an open-source project.  Freenode is a huge hub of open-source software groups and many well know projects maintain a presence there.  By moving our channel onto the Freenode network we hope to add a new arm to our existing community whilst expanding our reach further into the wider open-source community.  Also, since Freenode is quite a popular IRC network it's possible the IRC users amongst you may already have an account registered there.</p>
<p>MyBB staff will be around some of the time but this is <em><u>not</u></em> an official support resource.  Official support will remain to be solely available on the <a href="http://community.mybb.com">MyBB Community Forums</a>.  The IRC channel is intended as more of an informal place for users to come along and engage with other members of the community, although common sense rules will apply.</p>
<p>If you feel like coming along and joining us, you can do so by connecting your IRC client of choice to <strong>irc.freenode.net</strong> and joining <strong>#mybb</strong>.  Alternatively a web-chat interface is available at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">http://webchat.freenode.net/</a>.</p>
<p>Happy chatting.</p>

    <div class="blog-post__post post">
        <p>We've been reasonably quiet between the release of MyBB 1.4.4 and 1.4.5, but that doesn't mean that nothing has been going on behind the scenes. This blog post aims to outline some of what has been going on at MyBB during the last couple of months.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks you may have noticed a few changes with our current staff, whether it was removal of staff or a change of position. Some changes may not even be noticeable by you but I'll outline them all anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chris Boulton</strong><br />
Due to time restraints placed on Chris by work, Chris was finding it difficult to find a balance between work and play whilst including MyBB and therefore has shifted some of the lower priority, day-to-date responsibilities of product management to Dennis Tsang. To be clear, Chris will still be involved in the MyBB project and will be overseeing the project from an executive aspect.</li>
<li><strong>Dennis Tsang</strong><br />
Dennis will be taking on more of the the day-to-day operations and administrative tasks that Chris Boulton used to do.</li>
<li><strong>destroyer (Kevin Camps)</strong><br />
Kevin will take on some content management duties, this includes the MyBB website, MyBB Wiki, etc. Kevin will also be partly responsible for approving themes, plugins and resources to the Mods section of the MyBB site and help out coordinating the translations with Tochjo.</li>
<li><strong>Ryan Loos</strong><br />
Ryan has made the move from a Support Team member to a Public Relations Liaison. With this new title, Ryan will be responsible for resolving community issues, updating the blog, making <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> updates from the <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBB">MyBB Twitter account</a>, seeking new talent to take up positions on the team, in future betas and in the Mentor group and educating other communities on MyBB if their views are a little off.</li>
<li><strong>Justin S.</strong><br />
Justin is now in the developers' group although he will still maintain the Wiki and continue his design work. He was always a design developer on the team, so the title change just reflects his correct role, although he will be performing all of the same duties as he did before.</li>
<li><strong>Tomm M</strong><br />
Tom's moved into a developer's position from his old role as a Support Team member. He's shown a good understanding of how MyBB's insides work during his time on the team and has already taken on a good portion of development for MyBB 1.6.</li>
<li><strong>Max Marze</strong><br />
Max too has become a developer and will be working towards getting the new version of the MyBB Merge System out. Specifically, he will help by writing unit testing scripts to ensure that the Merge System, when released in the future, will not have as many problems as in previous releases.</li>
<li><strong>MattRogowski </strong><br />
Matt, though still a part of the Support Team, will also be partly responsible for approving themes, plugins and resources to the Mods section of the MyBB site.</li>
<li><strong>sayakb</strong><br />
Sayak has offered to come on board as an SQA Team member. He's shown a strong knowledge of MyBB by developing plugins, which can be found at the KDE forums, and testing new MyBB releases for compatibility with the KDE forums.</li>
<li><strong>LegosJedi</strong><br />
We're saying goodbye to LegosJedi who has left us due to time constraints. We wish LegosJedi best of luck on his future endeavors.</li>
<li><strong>Tom Loveric</strong><br />
Tom has also decided to head his own direction with a custom CMS he is building. We wish him the best of luck in his future and with his CMS.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recruiting New Support Staff</h4>
<p>We're always looking out for new potential. If you want to be on the MyBB Team, you just have to show:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are dedicated and active to the project</li>
<li>You speak English very well and have good communication skills</li>
<li>You have good knowledge of how MyBB works and in the position you want to take up</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't feel like we’re noticing you it's probably just because we're too busy making the next version of MyBB! So just send us an email via our <a href="http://mybboard.net/contact">contact form</a> with "Available Team Member Position" as the subject. <b>Include your forum username.</b> Remember though, your chances are considerably increased if you stand out with the three suggestions listed above.</p>
<h4>SQA Team Updates</h4>
<p>You might have also noticed the creation of the SQA Team (Software Quality Assurance) right after the release of 1.4.4 due to the amount of problems that were reported after its release. SQA has been able to confirm 95% of fixes are working and don't cause any regressions that are written by our developers and put into our code base. Among those that they confirmed, SQA was able to find and report dozens of regressions over the course of the entire MyBB 1.4.5 development in over 100 bugs, optimizations, and tweaks. As such, SQA has been a huge success for the MyBB Group and in turn creates much more stable releases for you. We are continuing to perfect the new SQA Team and implement processes that will eliminate preventable issues from the get-go.</p>
<h4>Team Interviews</h4>
<p>If you've ever wanted to know more about the MyBB Group or a particular staff member, now is the chance!  We've started <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/thread-48501.html">a thread</a> where you can post questions for staff members to answer at a later date in a blog post. If you have any questions for specific staff members or groups of staff then head over to the thread and post your questions!</p>

A series of posts which will contain a full overview of the MyBB 1.4 Admin CP including many screenshots, feature overviews and our design and technical decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Plugin Development Tips &amp; Tricks<br />
</strong>A few tips and tricks for getting the most out of the MyBB Plugin System.</li>
<li><strong>Regular MyBB Tips and Tricks<br />
</strong>Ranging from security related tips and tricks right through to uncovering some of the more hidden features and customising your copy of MyBB.</li>
<li><strong>Behind the Scenes<br />
</strong>A look at how things happen behind the scenes with MyBB, including our development process.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you're looking forward to being able to discuss some of the things above with us on this blog, as we're very much interested in your feedback for a lot of the above to help improve MyBB in the future. Stay tuned for another post shortly.</p>
